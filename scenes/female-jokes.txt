The girl who sits next to you in school has just passed you a note, folded in a tight square. She motions to you to read it. You look around the room. Mr. Henessey, the meanest teacher in the school, has his back to the class.
*page_break
The note says, "Did you notice that Mr. Henessey's underpants are pulled up so high, you can see them right through his shirt?" Your realization of this is enough to give you an uncontrollable case of the giggles.

Melissa Bradley steps out of her seat, stands up and begins to act like she is really scared (this is her forte). While she is making believe she doesn't know what the teacher is talking about (on the verge of tears), she crumples up
the note and slips it under her desk.

Mr. Henessey asks her to show him what she has in her hands. Both hands fan open, revealing two pink palms. She turns to you and lets another giggle loose.

Melissa Bradley looks at the teacher with innocent eyes. She points to you and says, "She was just passing me this homework assignment, Mr. Henessey." He says, "Bring it up here." She shows it to him. (You could just DIE!)
*page_break
Mr. Henessey reads it and looks at you sternly. Then he looks at Melissa. He says, "Ms. Bradley, do you take me for some kind of fool? I can tell your terrible handwriting a mile away. Get to the principal's office!"

The note returns and you read what it says, "Maryanne Marcus says she caught them kissing in the parking lot. (YUK!)"

Your level of impulse control shows that you can get yourself back into control when necessary. You have a quick laugh, then calm down before Mr. Henessey (even with his radar ears) can pinpoint the location of the disturbance.

The noise attracts Mr. Henessey's attention. He begins walking down the aisle, and your heart begins to race. He looks you squarely in the eye--the smell of his cologne is so overpowering, it could kill you all by itself. You cough.
*page_break
He says, "Can't you use that scrap paper for something else before you throw it away? Protect our natural resources!" You breathe a sigh of relief.
