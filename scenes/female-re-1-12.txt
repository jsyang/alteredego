You and ${loverName} have just had a nice, romantic date. He has treated you well all evening -- movies, a bite to eat, the works. Now he is feeling very romantic, but you really feel like talking. When you tell him this, he gets very annoyed
saying, "We talked ALL night long." He looks at you with that begging, pleading look in his eye. What do you want to do?

You tell him that you don't appreciate his octopus imitation, while squirming out of his grasp. You tell him that, unless he stops, you are going to either scream, throw him out or disable his equipment. He doesn't stop. What will you do?

You give in to ${loverName}'s primitive urges but don't feel quite right about doing it. After he is satisfied with what he has "gotten," he tenderly kisses you good night and leaves. You don't know why, but all of a sudden you feel like crying.
