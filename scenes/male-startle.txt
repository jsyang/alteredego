Mom and Dad are entertaining some friends and you are minding your own business sitting quietly in a corner of the room. Suddenly, a man with a big nose and a shiny head puts his face right up to yours and says something in a loud voice.

Who is this crazy person? He scared you half out of your wits. Screaming is a good defense. Your dad comes over and gives you a hug. Your mom thinks this man has had enough to drink.

A large target and you hit it dead center. You reacted offensively to a potentially terrifying situation. You are learning to stick up for yourself, but don't forget to rely on your parents; they might have helped in this
situation.

WAAAAAaaaaaa AAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Your eyes bulge and your heart beats fast. You were startled. This is your first encounter with a person who is less than delicate in the social sense. Your Dad comforts you and Mom leads the man back
to bother the adults.

BAM! You give him a right to the schnoz, which feels rough and oily. You are terrified and he thinks you are playing with him. Fortunately, your Dad spots him and ushers him back to bother people closer to his own age.

This is not a very sensible response.  Most people would have been very startled at this. Either you have nerves of steel, or you are not focusing in on potentially hazardous situations in the world around you. Please be more
careful.
