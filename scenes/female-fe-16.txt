You awake one morning and in the confusion of being still in a daze, you remember...

THIS IS ${childName}'s wedding day!

You hurry to get ready, helping to check on all of the last minute arrangements. The ceremony is truly heartwarming. My, children do grow up fast. As you watch your handsome son walk down the aisle, you begin to beam with pride. (There's
Mrs. Harris and her spinster daughter, Louise. She thought Louise was too good for your son. Now she's sorry.)

A few more steps and he'll be on his own. For a moment you are filled with overwhelming sadness. Suddenly, you begin to think about the pattering of little feet running around the house again. A whole new generation of blessings yet to
arrive. You say the word "Grandma" to yourself, not thinking about the age associated with it, just the two words "grand" and "mother."
