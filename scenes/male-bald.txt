While combing your hair one day, you notice that a few strands are falling out into the sink. When you wake in the morning, you notice that clumps of your hair cover your pillow. Soon, when you look in the mirror you see a shining
patch of scalp peeking through. You are going bald.

Baldness is a circumstance that one out of about every three men encounters. For some people it is the most devastating event of their lives. For others, like yourself, it is accepted with grace and poise. You base your perception
of yourself on past accomplishments and values rather than on superficial qualities. You should be proud of yourself.

You should have known better. These creams and lotions don't stand a chance of working. You continue to lose your hair. How much will you let going bald affect the way you feel about yourself?

I can certainly sympathize with you. You probably feel cheated and betrayed. Your hair ran out on you when you needed it most. Maybe someday medicine will come up with an effective, safe treatment for baldness, but for now, try not
to be so hard on yourself.

You can't help feeling like you have been robbed of something that others tend to value, but you convince yourself that people will ultimately judge you by who you are, not what you look like. Try not to attract attention to your
bald spot by covering it up with long strands of hair from other places on your head. This almost always guarantees that you will be ridiculed.

You must have a very solid sense of self-esteem. Going bald can sometimes ruin a man's opinion of himself. You obviously understand that people will judge you by who you are, not what you look like. Even though you may learn in time to
grow proud of your bald pate, keep out of the sun on extremely warm days.  You will be especially sensitive to sunburn for a while.

Please change your mind about this. Nothing looks more obvious than when you take a long piece of hair and attempt to wrap it back and forth across your scalp a hundred times. One good gust of wind and you're finished. Are you
still intent on doing this?
