During a sexual experience with your wife, you notice your mind drifting off. You begin to imagine your wife as your favorite movie star, and suddenly you are more aroused than ever. ${spouseName} notices the change and asks what got into you.

Yes, I know. It's always easier to accept this kind of behavior in yourself rather than thinking about your wife doing it. Just think of it this way -- would you rather have her THINKING about it or ACTING IT OUT?!

She tells you she once imagined that you were the check-out clerk at the local supermarket, you know, that young kid with all of the muscles. How do you feel?

I guess you don't think it's fair if your wife uses somebody that's not a famous TV star for the object of your fantasy. Well why not? Why limit your thoughts and fantasies to only those who are well known? Will you begin to belive that
her admission to you is a sign that your marriage is in trouble?

    *goto F1
  #NO

*label F1
Think about it -- would you rather have her THINK about such things or actually DO them? We all have fantasies, but there's a big difference between pretending and the real thing.
*finish
*label F2
Well it's not. As long as the person can distinguish between fantasy and reality, it is unlikely that they will ever act the fantasy out as long as the marriage is built on a strong foundation.

Perhaps you were expecting a big-time, inaccessible star. Looks like your wife's fantasies come from sources closer to home. I can certainly understand why you might feel a bit threatened by this, but think about it this way: Would you
rather have your wife FANTASIZING these things or DOING them?
