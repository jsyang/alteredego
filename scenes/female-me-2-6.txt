${spouseName} has decided that he would like to quit work, go back to college and change his career. He claims to feel bored with his present life and craves the change. His going back would cause you to have more responsibilities.
*page_break
You would also have fewer resources because of college costs, transportation expenses and any loss of income if ${spouseName} stops working. What will you do?

Over the course of his studies, you begin to see ${spouseName} less and less. It seems that he has discovered a new life at school. There are newer younger friends
(both men and women), and lots of talk about things which either don't interest you or you don't understand. At this point you can:

  #SAY NOTHING BECAUSE HE SEEMS HAPPY

  #SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE SOME COURSES TOGETHER

${spouseName} can understand this, because he has felt a little neglected more than a few times. He had to tolerate these feelings, and so must you. He has no plans to quit what he is doing, because he enjoys it too much.

It is a hard thing to accept, but eventually you realize how crucial this change is to ${spouseName}. As a matter of fact, he does quite well at it. Eventually, he graduates. How do you feel?

That is very admirable of you. He becomes more successful than ever. You both benefit emotionally and financially.

This statement is condescending, and even if you don't admit it, the condescension shows through. ${spouseName} is aware that you never appreciated his desire to learn. One of the things he learned best was not to seek the approval of anyone (not
even a wife) before doing something that will enrich his life. This change in his life  becomes a source of resentment for both of you.

${spouseName} thinks you are acting like a stubborn child. He is changing his life for the better, and you are resisting that change. Perhaps you don't feel comfortable about ${spouseName} getting "too smart." He may realize that you are selfish and that
you put your own best interests ahead of his.

Yes, he IS happy. Unfortunately, his happiness may make you feel a little left out. But there are times in a marriage when people begin to lose track of who they are, other than "the husband of so-and-so" or "the wife of so-and-so."
*page_break
This can cause a great deal of confusion and resentment. He needed to find out just what he was capable of doing on his own. As it turns out, your husband
does very well in school and eventually graduates. How do you feel?

I can see why you think this would be a terrific idea. ${spouseName} doesn't think so. He is taking college courses to advance in life. This would only complicate things.
*page_break
He doesn't want to give you up; he just wants to see what he is capable of accomplishing. He would rather you take your college courses at a different school. How do you feel about this?

I can understand why you feel this way -- you WERE rejected, but at least he was honest. Eventually ${spouseName} finishes school and is ready to graduate. How do you feel?

There comes a point in almost every man's life when he asks himself if he has done exactly what he wants to do in life.

This can cause real panic. Often times a person will choose going back to school as a way of satisfying a long-held life ambition. Are you sure you want to keep discouraging him from going back?

Then, I'm sure you can see that you are headed for trouble. Creating an issue out of ${spouseName}'s desire to go back to college only clarifies in his mind that he is not in control of his own destiny. He yearns for a new freedom. As a result,
he files for divorce and leaves you.

It is very understanding of you to change your mind. ${spouseName} does well in school and eventually graduates. How do you feel?

${spouseName} wonders whether you think he would be foolish enough to consider doing something like this without giving it a lot of thought. He produces a carton full of college catalogs and brochures, sample schedules and a list of requirements
for his new major.
