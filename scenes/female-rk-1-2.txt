Your parents are gone for the weekend! Even though you have been given STRICT orders to keep large numbers of friends out of the house, you know that it would be very easy to throw a party without anyone finding out. Of course, this
would greatly increase your social status, and make you extremely popular.

It's the police! They take down your name and ask where your parents are. They suggest that you clear everyone out to avoid a summons for violating the noise ordinance. Four complaints have been lodged already.

When your folks return, they hear the news about your gathering. You deny that things were wild, but they pick at all the little things like a minor crack in one of the walls, and a small dent in the refrigerator door. You are grounded
for a week.

It's just another group of "friends." Groups of people come and go throughout the night. Some "crash" on the living room floor, but those who do, volunteer to help you clean up the next morning.

When they are finished everything looks as good as new. No one finds out about your "gathering." Trustworthiness decreases, but Socially, you are a smashing success!
