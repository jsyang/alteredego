At a party at the house of one of your friends, Linda Martels (a.k.a. "The Most Incredible Fox In The Eighth Grade") asks you to be her partner in a game that some of the kids are playing. The game is called "Seven Minutes In Heaven."
It is played like this:
*page_break
All of the "couples" find a place to be comfortable in a very large room. Someone is in charge of working the lights. When the lights go out, the couples make out (and stuff) for seven minutes. When the lights get turned back on
the couples can either stay with each other or switch partners.

All of a sudden Linda cries out, "GROSS!" You are mortified, but guys who have had her as a partner before know just what happened. You get their sympathy, but as far as Linda is concerned, your time is up. NEXT!

You put your hand there half-expecting to be rejected. For about thirty seconds, Linda doesn't seem to mind. You finally relax and think about your next move when ...SLAP! You are caught off guard. Your hand is removed from
the offending area and your Seven Minutes are brought to an abrupt end.

That stuff only works on T.V. and in cheap novels. You treat her ear as if it were a piece of dried fruit. "Yeeeeeeech! You disgusting ANIMAL," Linda cries out. Your Seven Minutes are brought to an abrupt end.

As you kiss her, you feel her moving close to you, pressing her chest up against yours. You can:

You are overwhelmed and afraid that you will not be able to handle what could come next. Linda giggles as you head for the door. Steam is rising from your collar.

Her hands slide up and down your chest and brush across your leg. You can:

She pulls your shirt out of your pants and runs her hands up and down your chest. She kisses you on the neck...on the chest...on the stomach... and then reaches for the snap on your jeans.
*page_break
LIGHTS ON! You look up at Linda dazed and panting like a wild animal. You try to regain your composure and hope that she doesn't notice that you are slobbering on yourself. Linda asks you if you want a soda or a napkin and
wiggles out of the room with a smile on her face.
*page_break
You think to yourself, "It's only a few minutes until the next round." Linda returns with Mark "Pizza Face" Garfield. As she passes by she asks, "Who are YOU gonna pick next?"

You are obviously interested in bigger and better things (baseball perhaps). Besides, rumor has it that Linda is nothing more than a big tease with a perfect sense of timing for when that Seven Minutes are up.
*page_break
You have seen the casualties at other parties: some boys walking half bent over for hours at a time, others pulling on her leg screaming, "Please, Linda, just one more minute...thirty seconds...anything!" Others have been reduced to
slobbering masses of crushed desire. It's not a pretty sight.
