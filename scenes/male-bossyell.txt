I'm sorry. In order to play through this icon, you need a steady job. You may go to the WORK ICON and apply for one, then return.

You have been going through a difficult time with an influential business-person who seems to really enjoy making people miserable with his moodiness, his arbitrary decision-making, and his arrogance.
*page_break
You get called into his office to take the heat for a relatively minor error. The conversation begins: "Look, son. I've had just about all of the incompetence from you that I can stand. What have you got to say for yourself...?"

Your boss is shocked. He leans back in his chair and says, "This is the first real spunk you've ever shown me, son. I like a man who knows how to speak his mind. That still doesn't let you off the hook for doing something stupid and
incompetent. You're out of a job"

"OUCH! WHY YOU @^%#@& (@#*&@ ) (@#@(." The punches and expletives follow fast and furious, then suddenly, the old man clutches his heart and begins to wheeze. He slumps over in his chair and passes out cold. It looks like he's had a heart
attack! You try to revive him, but he's a goner. The BIG boss walks in while you are trying to revive him...

By this time you have drawn a crowd. The entire office is laughing as he is throwing everything at you, including his shoes. You leave to a hearty round of applause. Suddenly, the BIG boss walks by and demands to know what is going on.
The man is STILL ranting and raving like a lunatic, unaware that the BIG boss is now within listening distance.

You tell the BIG boss, "You see, sir, the hallucinations began about three months ago. He started yelling 'THE VOICES...THE VOICES...PLEASE STOP THE VOICES!' There was no controlling him after that. He has these fits about once a week,
usually at staff meetings." After hearing this the BIG boss puts you in charge. You get a bonus!

"O.K." the man whispers, "How about this?" His voice is barely audible, as he motions you over to the desk. He puts his arm around your shoulder and screams, "YOU'RE FIRED! OUT! OUT! I WANT YOU OUT!"

"As a matter of fact, no, I don't," is his reply. He continues to chew you out and he finally finishes.

You are indeed calm enough to behave this way in this situation. Your calmness serves as a positive influence on this person, who realizes he is treating you unfairly. (Calm people do influence others this way.)

He interprets your aloofness as a sign of disrespect in the most extreme form. He fires you. He exaggerates his anger and behavior just to see if he can get a rise out of you, without realizing that the BIG boss is standing right outside
the office. When you emerge the BIG boss wants to know what has been going on.
