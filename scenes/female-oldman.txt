The boy spots you approaching and runs away. This potentially dangerous experience ends rather peacefully. The old man hugs you lightly. He was terrified.

By the time you find anyone who could help, the old man has already been robbed and roughed up. He is in a state of panic and is coughing hard. The mugger has escaped.

You will be old someday, too. I hope others will show care towards you.
