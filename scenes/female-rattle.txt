Lying on your stomach in the crib, you notice an interesting object an arm's distance away. It has a round shape at the top, and a ring on the bottom.

You should never try to do a job when you are angry. You make random swiping movements at the rattle, and your frustration increases.

You get lucky. Your little pinky catches the ring on the bottom of the rattle, and it spins around your finger making a long, pleasing sound. You are becoming the type of person who won't take no for an answer--an aggressive,
goal-oriented type. Be careful--you just might get everything you bargain for.

You miss. Your hand spins the rattle farther out of your reach. Every time you miss, your rage increases.

If you could talk, you would be cursing and swearing at that rattle, but there will be plenty of time for that later, when you are trying to get your hair to look right the day AFTER you get it cut and styled.

You quit trying but you sulk, not able to let go of your anger. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and you are forced to drown your troubles in a bottle of strained carrot juice (yum!).

Why give up so easily? Do you think that life will get any easier? Don't count on it. Your first cliche: If at first you don't succeed...

Yes, saliva is something that infants seem to have a never-ending supply of. Manufacturing it will come in handy when someone you don't like picks you up and starts spinning you around over his or her face. Keep practicing.

This stimulates vocal cords and language centers in your brain. Good language skills are essential to development. Intellectual sphere increases. If no one is looking, give a little yell for yourself for choosing this option. Go on.

I can't blame you for not taking a more active interest in your environment just yet. Be careful. Being neutral, not taking risks and choosing options that seem dull will get you nowhere and leave you at the mercy of fate.

How could these two choices possibly go together? I will let you go back and try a more sensible set of responses for now, but let me warn you. Choosing responses without thinking about them first might be interpreted as a sign of poor
judgment. People who have poor judgment usually wind up having very difficult lives. Please try again.
