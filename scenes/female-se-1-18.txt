In gym, everyone has to take The President's Test (or something like that) for physical fitness. Everyone has to run the 50-yard dash. Last year, when Mary was running, she tripped at the end. All the Belmar Hills boys were watching.
They were extremely cruel.

What the hell, right? You give it all you've got and run the fastest 50-yard dash in school. The boys call you Lightnin' for a while.

No way. You're not going to knock yourself out for this test. Like the president really CARES if you can run 50 yards. Really.
