I'm sorry. In order to play through this icon, you need a steady job. You may go to the WORK ICON and apply for one, then return.

You and a group of people you work with are sitting around and having a discussion. The person sitting next to you looks up and says, "I could sure go for a cup of coffee." Several people look up and agree with the suggestion.

Turning to you he says, "Would you make us a fresh pot of coffee? I'm all thumbs, and I hate to go out when there's a coffee maker right here."

You must be trying to give yourself an ulcer! I guess you think that you really have no choice in the matter. Well, as a matter of fact you do. Your Confidence must be very low.

That fellow is the one at work who is known for making the most socially inapproriate comments. There is one in every office. Everyone giggles as you tear him apart, but for some strange reason, people feel sorry for him and see YOU as
hostile.

Your personality is one that is tempered with gentleness. Even though you would probably like to haul off and belt this guy, you keep cool. You explain that you are not his or anybody else's slave and that you will gladly TEACH him how
to make the coffee. "Can't depend on women for everything," you say.

Your personality is too explosive to deal with him in an angry but effective way. You blow your stack at him, but everyone thinks you are overdoing it.

You must either feel comfortable enough with yourself to ignore his comments and make some coffee because YOU want some. If not, you must feel that it is okay for men to treat women like they are their personal servants. A female
co-worker asks you if you were offended by the guy. Which do you believe?

Sometimes if you ignore someone long enough he or she will just go away. Unfortunately, people like this never learn. You refuse to give him the pleasure of seeing you get upset and intimidated. Bravo.
