The local police are called in to search the lockers for illegal substances. Have you stashed anything in there (besides your now-fossilized gym socks) that you don't want anyone to find?


Select an action:

  #YES
    *goto A1
  #NO
    *goto A2
*label A1
*set TH%-10

Well, they found it. You are in trouble again.

That's not likely, considering your history of heavy partying. They find remnants of drugs and drug paraphernalia, but not enough to convict you of anything.

*if OH>5
  *goto C.T

  *goto C.F
*label C.T
*set CA%-10
Well, they are suspicious of you anyway, since you have been known to do some partying around town. They find nothing.

The only things they find are two pieces of dried-out pizza from the cafeteria. At first, they think the pizza is the product of some sort of Satanic ritual. After they have it analyzed, they send the Board of Health to inspect the
kitchen.
