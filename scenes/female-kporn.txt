Your mother has been out all day and has just phoned to tell you that she's stuck with the car. She sounds exhausted. Dinner hasn't even been started yet, and the house will be filling up with people any minute. It looks like it's
going to be a ZOO. You are supposed to go out with your friends. The best place to be after she gets home would be miles away.

An interesting concoction. Everyone makes unusual noises of approval when they eat it. You are terrific!

Quick and easy. It satisfies all of the hungry beasts in the house and doesn't take much time. You can still go out with your friends. Mom slips you $20 for spending money and gives you a big kiss. You are terrific!

A bold plan!

But not very bright. The concoction you create should be photographed, then buried. Mom is really impressed by the sentiment. She gives you a big kiss and slips you $20 for spending money. You are terrific!

That wasn't very thoughtful of you. Your mom doesn't say anything to you, but thinks you should have been mature enough to start dinner and help out. The free ride at home doesn't last forever.
