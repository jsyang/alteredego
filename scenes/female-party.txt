A group of your parents' closest friends have come over for dinner. You are fed early and put upstairs to entertain yourself.

I don't blame you for feeling angry at your parents. After all, who's more important, a bunch of stupid friends or you? You peek out of your room and head down the stairs. You have everyone in view.

Your mother sees you crying and feels sorry for you. She takes you downstairs for five minutes and lets you mingle with the guests. They like you, but soon the novelty of your presence wears off.

Oops! You are caught by your mom, who tells you not to drink things from other people's glasses. That drink was for grownups only. Back to the bedroom for you.

Good choice. That drink was for grownups only. There are some cookies on the table over there. Do you want to:

CRASH! The entire tray of cookies hits the floor with a loud clang. Fortunately for you, there are too many people standing around for your mother to paddle you for this. Instead, you get THE FACE. You will regret it if you try anything
else tonight.

Why don't they have any cartoons on at this time of night? You fall asleep on your parents' bed. Your dad comes up to check on you, finds you sleeping and brings you to your own room. He tucks you in and says, "I love you." Your
Confidence takes a healthy jump.

BOING! BOING! BOING! CRASH! You fall off the bed and land on the floor, knocking your head on the bedpost. Your mom rushes up the stairs. You are more afraid than in pain, but you get a lump on your head anyway. You sit on the couch
downstairs for the rest of the night. This isn't as much fun as you thought it would be.

This certainly gets a reaction from your parents (who are completely mortified) and their friends (who are relieved that someone else's child does things like that). After your dad puts some clothes on you, he takes you downstairs and
lets you wander around. You spot a drink on the table.

Big mistake. Your dad comes up and uses the LOUD VOICE to let you know you were bad. You are put back in your room and told to go to sleep.

Your mother has put up a gate so you can't get downstairs. Oh, well, it might be fun to see what you can do upstairs--something your parents would normally not allow you to do. I'm glad you didn't take offense when they didn't invite
you to their party. If you have to stay upstairs, you might as well have some
fun, right?

These two choices don't go together. When a person is depressed, she becomes self-absorbed. When you get older, these two choices can lead to very self- destructive consequences. For now, go back and try another set of choices.
