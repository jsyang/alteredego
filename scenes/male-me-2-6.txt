${spouseName} has decided that she would like to go back to college full time to enrich her life. She claims to feel bored with her present life and craves the change. Her going back would cause you to have more responsibilities.
*page_break
You would have to cook and clean up a bit more. You would also have fewer resources, because of college costs, transportation expenses, and any loss of income if ${spouseName} stops working. What will you do?

That was very supportive of you.

Over the course of her studies, you begin to see ${spouseName} less and less. It seems that she has discovered a new life at school. There are newer, younger friends (both men and women), and lots of talk about
things which either don't interest you, or you don't understand. At this point you can:

  #SAY NOTHING BECAUSE SHE SEEMS HAPPY

  #SUGGEST THAT YOU BOTH TAKE A COURSE TOGETHER

${spouseName} can understand this, because she has felt a little neglected more than a few times. She had to tolerate these feelings, and so must you. She has no plans to quit what she is doing, because she enjoys it too much.

It is a hard thing to accept, but eventually you realize how crucial college is to ${spouseName}. As a matter of fact, she does quite well at it. Eventually, she graduates. How do you feel?

That is very admirable of you. She is proud of herself as well. Now, about graduate school....

This statement is condescending, and even if you don't admit it, the condescension shows through. ${spouseName} is aware that you never appreciated her desire to learn. One of the things she learned best was not to seek the
approval of anyone (not even a husband) before doing something that will enrich her life. Her college education becomes a source of resentment for both of you.

*set MP+1
${spouseName} thinks you are acting like a stubborn child. She is changing her life for the better, and you are resisting that change. Perhaps you don't feel comfortable about ${spouseName} getting "too smart." She may realize that you are
selfish and that you put your own best interests ahead of hers. Her college education becomes a source of resentment for both of you.

Yes, she IS happy. Unfortunately, her happiness may make you feel a little left out. But there are times in a marriage when people begin to lose track of who they are, other than "the husband of so-and-so" or "the wife of so-and-so."
*page_break
This can cause a great deal of confusion and resentment. If you try to help your spouse out of this dilemma, she will resent you for not letting her figure it out for herself. As it turns out, your wife does very well in school and
eventually graduates. How do you feel?

I can see why you think this would be a terrific idea. ${spouseName} doesn't think so. She is taking college courses to become more of an individual. As difficult as it may seem to understand, she is trying to separate a part of herself from you.
*page_break
She doesn't want to give you up; she just wants to see what she is capable of doing on her own. She would rather you take your college courses at a different school. How do you feel about this?

There comes a point in almost every marriage when a spouse may begin to question the separateness of his or her own identity. A person may wake up one day and ask the question, "Who am I besides the (husband/wife) of so-and-so?"
*page_break
This can cause real panic. Often times a person will choose going back to school as a way of regaining some individuality or independence. Are you sure you want to keep discouraging her from going back?

Then, I'm sure you can see where you are headed for trouble. Creating an issue out of your wife's desire to go back to college only clarifies in her mind the feeling that she has been living in your shadow, or is expected to live in
your shadow. As a result, she files for divorce and leaves you.

It is very understanding of you to change your mind. ${spouseName} does well in school and eventually graduates. How do you feel?

${spouseName} wonders whether you think she would be foolish enough to consider doing something like this without giving it a lot of thought. She produces a carton full of college catalogs and brochures, sample schedules and a list of
requirements for her major.
