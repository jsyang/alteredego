A group of kids you hardly know have just made fun of you. Usually, this might not bother you, but lately you have been feeling down in the dumps about a lot of things.
*page_break
Your physical appearance has been disappointing you, your family has been giving you a hard time about almost everything; and no one seems to be saying or doing anything positive toward you. You have a bad case of the blues.

Your family tries to help, but they give you too much direct advice. They say "You need to go out more, find new friends." Mom says, "You take life too seriously. Try to look on the bright side of things." This makes you so angry, you
forget your depression. Well, at least they cared enough to try to help.

Your family seems concerned, but they begin to lecture you about your faults, instead of being supportive. This infuriates you.
*finish
*label B2
You explain your problems to your friend. Your friend seems very supportive, but every time you list a complaint, your friend lists one of her own problems. You begin to think that she isn't listening to you. The conversation doesn't
turn out to be very helpful.

The psychologist explains that what you are feeling is a normal part of adolescent development, and sympathizes with your feelings of being sad. Over the next three months, you meet with the psychologist regularly, learning how to
express yourself to your family and friends. All in all, it is a very positive experience.

Sometimes, when people become depressed, they use alcohol or other substances to anesthetize themselves from the painful feelings. This is one theory about why people eventually become substance abusers.

The fact that you have chosen this means of coping with depression, combined with the fact that you are somewhat impulsive, suggests a high probability that you will become a drug or alcohol abuser later in life.

It may sound like an old cliche, but the fact is that time DOES heal all (or at least most) wounds. Research shows that many people have the ability to "ride through" their depressions.

Being in a bad mood is usually not a strong enough reason to cause a person to think about killing herself. Therefore, it is likely that you chose these responses just to get attention. This is a dangerous way to try to make a
connection with someone.
*page_break
If no one responds to your style of getting attention, you will have to increase the severity of your behavior. If you still get no one to pay attention, you might have to go so far as to hurt yourself. Some people have even killed
themselves while trying to draw attention to trying to kill themselves.

This is a very drastic way to get attention. The likelihood of doing something self-destructive in this frame of mind is very great. Would you like to change your mind?

Your fascination with the thought of tempting fate with your own life causes you to misjudge the level of alcohol and drugs you take in. You are too charged up to feel the effects of these substances, so you take too much. You are
found dead of liver failure and blood poisoning the day after you make the gesture. Your game is over.

This doesn't sound like a very sensible choice. People who walk around feeling suicidal often kill themselves by accident, just because it is so prominent in their minds. You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.

*label A33
You are denying the feelings you have, which may cause you to act them out inappropriately. It is perfectly O.K. to feel blue some of the time. Life can't always be rosy. You probably would have felt better talking to someone about it.
*finish
*label A32
*set OH+4
You have chosen an infantile way of dealing with your stress. Instead of experiencing the depression and dealing with it, you have chosen to wash it away by chemically altering your frame of mind. This method brings you relief, but it
sets you into a pattern that can lead to alcohol or drug addiction.
