You and ${loverName} are both thinking through your decisions about going to college. ${loverName} wants to go to a college that has a strong pre-med program. There are none in the area.
*page_break
Attending that college would mean that he would need to travel a great distance. You wouldn't see each other for long periods of time. Which one of these things reflects your feelings on this?

Sure you are angry. Who wouldn't be? As a result of your anger, will you:

This leads to ${loverName} resenting you. Even if the relationship survives the final decision, it will ultimately break down because you seem to want to control his life.

That is very admirable. People sometimes believe they can prevent their anger from surfacing at times like this. That's not possible. Anger is a natural response to loss; ${loverName} going away to college would certainly qualify. You chose to
try to understand your anger as opposed to trying to chain ${loverName} down.
*page_break
Your relationship may not survive the distance and all the changes college will bring, but you are growing up to be the type of person who will ultimately succeed at finding a good partner to share life with.

*label A2
Your ambivalence pulls you in two directions at once. You want to please yourself by having ${loverName} with you, and you want to please ${loverName} by supporting his decision to go away to college. This is not something that you can work out in one
short episode.
*page_break
It is a difficult problem to resolve. Think about it--is it worth trying to tie ${loverName} down close to you if it means the possibility that he will resent you for it later on?

*set EX%-20
It seems as though you are trying to avoid your real feelings. There is hesitancy and confusion that you are not owning up to. How good could anyone feel after her boyfriend has just said he is leaving to go far away for a long period of
time?
