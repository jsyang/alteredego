You ignore it, but it doesn't go away. That's O.K., though. At your age something like that isn't bound to attract that much attention. At the very least you have saved yourself a bad sunburn. Go play.

You say: "Thank you, very much!!" and leap into the water, hoping to hide yourself. These little "surprises" happen all the time at your age. Now you don't appreciate them, but when you are much older you'll want them back.
People never seem to be satisfied.
