Your nervousness causes you to keep a watchful eye on everyone's behavior. After only a little alcohol is drunk you say, "O.K. guys, that's enough. I don't want to get in trouble." The next time your dad goes into the liquor
cabinet, he gets suspicious, but doesn't say anything to you. Familial characteristic decreases slightly because of Dad's suspiciousness and mistrust.
