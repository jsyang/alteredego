On a date with ${loverName} he begins to pry about your past relationships: who you've gone out with, why it didn't last and other personal questions. How does this cross-examination make you feel?

Perhaps there is more to this conversation than meets the eye. ${loverName} has marriage on his mind! The questions and conversation lean more and more toward wondering whether you are planning to settle down. How will you handle it?

This only makes him press you harder for your intentions.

You aren't being very expressive, and you're still avoiding him. He presses you. "Are you ever going to settle down?"

Then perhaps you are anxious about the thought of doing it with ${loverName}. He does deserve some indication of what your intentions are.

Ha! That's what they all say. Just wait until Mr. Right comes along -- he'll probably sweep you right off your feet!

I guess that must have been difficult to say, but at least ${loverName} knows where he stands. By the way, did you know that ${loverName} just happens to be the heir to a rather large fortune? Marrying him would put a cool $1,000,000 in your Resource
column. He's ready, you know. All you have to do is pop over to the MARRIAGE ICON and wait for him to pop the question.

Too late. Ms. Right #2 beat you to it!

You don't want anybody snooping into your personal life like that.

Your Gentleness characteristic shows that you can tell him to stop prying without sounding too hostile. He is put off by your annoyance, but the evening moves along smoothly.
*finish
*label E.F
You snap at him and sound hostile, as if you were protecting some well-guarded secret. This puts ${loverName} off. The evening ends early.
*finish
*label A3
He has you on the ropes now, kiddo! One sign of trepidation and he moves in for the BIG QUESTION. "So, do you see yourself settling down with anyone in the near future?"
