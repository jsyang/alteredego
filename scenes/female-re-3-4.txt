All night long ${loverName} seems to be on an emotional roller coaster. One minute he is smiling and happy, the next, he is staring off into the distance and looking blue.

${loverName} agrees that tonight this might be the best thing for the both of you. You never find out what he had on his mind.

That is very sensitive of you. It helps break past the wall of silence he has put up between you. Eventually, he tells you that

he can no longer bear being "the other man." He wants more of your time.
*page_break
He has become obsessed with thoughts of you being his constant companion. He is afraid that he will do something dangerous to himself if things do not change soon.

And what about the children? You'll never get custody of them.

You'll have to go to the MARRIAGE ICON and file for divorce, but before you do, I would suggest thinking it over very carefully.

After you end the relationship, you receive a desperate phone call from him saying that he is seriously thinking of ending it all. What will you do?

Rushing to his side reinforces the fact that he can manipulate you by threatening to harm himself. You are probably beginning to see that this is only one of the many ways that he actually controls you. Sooner or later you are going to
have to make some decisions. This affair has become sticky and complicated.

The most serious attempt he makes on his life is taking a whole box of antacids. Eventually, he leaves you alone.
*finish
*label G2
The suicide-attempt pattern sets the tone for the remainder of the relationship. Now every time you refuse to do what he wants, he talks about killing himself. By staying in this relationship you are playing into his needs for dependency
and salvation.
*page_break
Believe me, if you really wanted to leave him, chances are he wouldn't do anything harmful to himself other than eventually take up with another married woman. But you can never be too sure...

The attempt was not serious -- all he tried to do was swallow a small bottle of antacid tablets. It becomes clear that his suicidal behavior is a desperate attempt to manipulate and control you. It is often the case that people involved
in extramarital affairs have the fantasy of luring the lover away from his or her family and replacing the spouse.
*finish
*label D3
Of course he accepts this, because he wants to believe this more than anything else. For you, it's probably an attempt to have your cake and eat it, too. You get it, but every indulgence has its price.

He once served time for armed robbery. He was afraid you would find out and end your relationship with him.

He is married to someone who is in jail. (She was convicted of murder -- but it wasn't entirely her fault; they said it was "kind of" a crime of passion.) He is afraid that, now that you know, you will leave him. He claims to love you
but just doesn't think he could leave his wife.
*page_break
By the way, she's getting out next week. (Psssst...you might want to think about either increasing your health insurance coverage, or going back to the RELATIONSHIP ICON and ending it while you are still alive.)

After a long tearful deliberation, he tells you that

he likes you as a person but doesn't feel the least bit attracted to you, because you remind him too much of his mother. He believes the relationship just can't continue this way because
he knows he will never feel any differently. He says, (SOB!) "I'm sorry, Mama!"
