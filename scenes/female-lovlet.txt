It is springtime and love is in the air. You have been thinking about Rob Nielson night and day and have finally mustered the courage to write him a "secret admirer" note. Rob is every girl's dream. He's almost thirteen, has big, blue
eyes, and is captain of the soccer team.

You swear the friend to secrecy and he agrees. Unfortunately, he isn't the trustworthy type. The friend uses the letter to tease Rob (saying, "She wants to tell you how much she wants to LUUUUV you and KIIIISS you!"), and as a result Rob
ignores you.

You throw the note away. You are the cause of your own unrequited love. For weeks you suffer from the thought that Rob will slip through your fingers. One day, he asks if he could borrow a pen.

After using it to scrape some chewing gum off the bottom of his sneaker, he returns the pen and says, "Thanks."

Were you brave enough to sign the letter?

Too bad--he thinks that you are WEIRD and ignores you.

Good. When he sees the note, he thinks that whoever wrote it must be very WEIRD.

According to your status sheet, your Social skills are strong. Rob is flattered, but regrets to inform you that you are simply not his type. How do you feel about this?

I thought so. There are plenty of fish in the sea. At least you gave it your best shot. Right now, Rob's idea of a good time is spending all afternoon kicking a soccer ball at a funny-looking net. Puberty will change all that. Be patient.

It seems that your Social skills are just a cover-up for a lack of confidence. You are the type who does things for other people and not yourself. Examine this in yourself and see if it makes sense to you.

Your status sheet suggests that you have neither the Social skills nor the confidence to pull this off successfully. Rob thinks you are WEIRD and ignores both you and your letter. You get lots of credit for trying. Social sphere goes up
and anxiety decreases, as you realize that things aren't so bad when you know you've given it your best shot.
