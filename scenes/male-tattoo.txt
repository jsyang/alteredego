The tattoo is even more painful than you imagined it would be. You must leave the bandage on it until it becomes a scab. For a few days it oozes blood.

For some reason, they just don't find it all that attractive. As a matter of fact, your mother nearly faints at the sight of it. Eventually, they learn to accept it, but deep down inside it is one of those things that they will
never understand.

A tattoo can be hidden for a while, but not indefinitely. Eventually your mother sees it, and fails to appreciate its artistic merit. She becomes upset over the tattoo, but even more upset over the fact that you didn't tell her
about it. Sure, she would have been upset just the same, but not as much as she is now.
