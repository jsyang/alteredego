Dad must get his teeth fixed and you must go with him to the dentist (Mom is busy at work and Dad couldn't find a sitter). You sit in the waiting room for a very, very long time. Dad must run out and put money in the parking meter.
Dad sits you on the floor, gives you a magazine to leaf through, and tells you to behave.

Now you're feeling a bit more comfortable. A nosy lady spies you from the corner of her eye (What's she looking at?). Your sock is crooked.

Funny thing about socks, the way they stretch all the way out before they snap off your feet. You decide to take both of them off. (The lady looks at you again). Where's Dad?

Dad is on his way back in. He sees you with no socks and shoes on and feels embarrassed. The busybody lady gives him a full report.

You give her your worst face and get whacked on the bottom lightly by your Dad, who secretly approves of what you did. He buys you a big ice cream when you leave to make up for feeling guilty about patting you on the rear.

Good choice. Nothing can get on a grown-up person's nerves like a bratty kid who won't be controlled by scowls and ugly faces. Now what do you want to do?

The nurse sees you and gives you a big kiss. She points to a big box full of toys and asks you to go pick one out for yourself.

That was very polite of you, considering she really wasn't looking and you could have stuffed another one in your pocket. You are becoming a very trustworthy little boy.

Of course the nurse was too busy to see you sneak two little toys out of the box instead of one, and probably wouldn't care anyway. Unfortunately, behavior like this doesn't go unnoticed by everyone. You get away with it this time,
but please be more careful later, when you fill out your tax return.

You walk over to the pile of magazines on the stand, reach into the pile and pull out a magazine. Your coordination isn't terrific. As you lift it off the table, the cover tears with a loud R-I-I-I-P. A lady spies you from the
corner of her eye and gives you a dirty look.

Good. Climbing up on Dad's lap makes him feel like the two of you are a team. This is an important father-son bond that will come in handy if you get locked up for doing something stupid when you are an adolescent.

Before you know it she would have been slobbering all over your face. On the other hand, she was about to give you a piece of candy. Playing coy causes her to make noises at you (why do they all do that?) that make her look
absolutely ridiculous. You walk over and attach yourself to Dad's leg.

Your ability to keep yourself amused is a sign of early maturity. This will help you intellectually and creatively.
