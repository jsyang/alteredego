The trip to your honeymoon hideaway is a safe and pleasurable one.

Your honeymoon is peaceful and relaxing. Any problems you might have experienced on your wedding night are washed away by the peacefulness of your surroundings. This is the start of a lifetime that will be filled with many emotions. There
is love of course, but that will have to be tempered with tolerance.
*page_break
After all, loving someone who loves you in return is easy. Tolerating her when she is moody and irritable is difficult and may mean the difference between staying together or falling apart. Admiration will sometimes be offset by petty
jealousy. Desire for companionship will sometimes be replaced by a need for solitude.
*page_break
This kind of talk may seem premature at this stage of your marriage, but within the next two years things will start to become very difficult. The newness of the marriage will wear off and you will have to start coming to grips with the
fact that your partner is not as perfect as you would really like.
*page_break
This is not a bad thing, but it is reality. Your ability to adjust to your partner's strengths and weaknesses (and vice versa) will ultimately determine the success of your marriage. Good luck!
