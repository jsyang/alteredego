You are currently madly in love with a girl who is having a birthday next week. You are trying to think of what to get her. She has hinted about a very expensive piece of jewelry that would just about wipe out your life savings,
if you chose to buy it for her.

You will never be able to support this girl in the style to which she is accustomed. Eventually, she runs off with some guy who has a thousand-dollar smile, a ten-thousand-dollar sports car and a million dollar inheritance. Ta, ta!

Almost immediately after you purchase the jewelry, you begin to resent the decision -- and your girlfriend, too. The relationship falls apart, and to make matters worse, she keeps the jewelry.

Your Intellectual sphere status shows that you are smart enough to come up with an inventive gift idea, which she loves, and which doesn't leave you penniless.

It might be hard to come up with an idea for a present, but you do, and she loves you for it.

You buy her a soap dish and some hand towels (with some tacky Oriental design on them) which were on sale in "The Salvage Warehouse." She is less than impressed. You are given the brush-off.
