All of this rowing is putting a tremendous strain on your heart and lungs. You experience a mild heart attack, which puts ${loverName} in a panic. Fortunately, a passing boater rescues you both and brings you to a hospital where you must
recuperate for several weeks.

You have got to learn to SLOW DOWN. A positive aspect of this experience is that while you are in the hospital ${loverName} visits you daily. You enjoy the food and also the attention that she brings you.

developed.
