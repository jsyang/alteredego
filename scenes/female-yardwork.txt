After your third week of work, your friends plan a trip to the mall and ask if you would like to come along. Jamie's mother will be driving, but the trip will occur during the time when you babysit. There is no way you can squeeze the
two events in on the same day.

She doesn't mind. She simply asks a friend of yours who is happy to take the job and the money, AND skip shopping. She does a good job and replaces you permanently. Some friend!
