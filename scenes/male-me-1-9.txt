O.K. She serves first... THWACK! She aces you! THWACK! THWACK! THWACK! It's set point; you are losing.

She moves you side to side on the court like a puppet on a string. You are panting for breath, and her hair isn't even mussed. You refuse to let her win this point. By golly, if you do go down, you are going to go down fighting. THWACK!
THWACK! THWACK!
*page_break
She drives you back to the baseline with a lob, you make a futile stab at the ball and watch it sail toward the net. It makes it over! You're still alive. Your wife hits a forehand which again nails you to the baseline. You hit a powerful
return which skips right on the line. "OUT!" she calls.

"What do you mean 'OUT?!'" I'm sure you would start off with something like that, right? She claims the ball was out, but if you REALLY want the point that bad, she'll give it to you. You ARE losing 0 - 6, 0 - 5. Will you?

What a baby! O.K... Here goes... She tosses the ball high in the air... THWACK!... Her serve skids across the service line, and breezes past you.

You are usually pretty trustworthy, but I guess in this case the thought of losing outright was just too much for you.

That figures. With your Trustworthiness charateristic, you are exactly the type of person who would cheat in this situation. Tsk! Tsk!

I know this must have been a tough thing to swallow. Now tell the truth... Are you a bit angry at ${spouseName} for beating you.

Your Gentleness score seems to support the fact that you really wouldn't be. You must be a nice guy!

Your Gentleness score suggests that you might not really be letting the truth be known. In any case, I hope you don't take the loss too personally.

"Oooooch! My leg, my leg." You clutch your calf in agony and head for the bench. ${spouseName} becomes sympathetic and gives you a rubdown. Too bad she can't do the same thing for your sensitive psyche.

"My racket was strung too tight, the balls were dead, the sun was in my eyes, I was distracted by a mole burrowing in the field 100 yards away from here, my hearing is sensitive and I was interrupted by the space shuttle orbiting
overhead..."
