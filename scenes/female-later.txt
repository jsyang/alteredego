Your mom has promised that she will fix your doll's torn arm. She is talking on the phone (so she's not really doing anything). Now seems like a good time to remind her.

You say, "Mommmm...Oh, Mommmm." You move her back and forth. Her leg is very heavy. All of a sudden, she gives you THE LOOK, puts her hand over the phone and says, "WHAT do you want?" in a very loud whisper.

Your perseverance will come in handy in many situations. Unfortunately, this is definitely not one of them. Mom makes sure that her hand is really tight around the mouthpiece. She says, "NO!" in a way that shakes the whole house. You may
cry a little here if you feel you have to, but it won't help.

Mom makes her eyes really big, and takes a deep breath. You know what's coming now, so you take off for a sheltered area in the house. I guess you frustrated her.

She is feeling so relaxed, that she asks you to go on a little trip with her. She not only fixes your doll, but takes you out and buys you a new "friend" to keep your doll company!

She fixes your doll, then Dad takes you out for a king-sized ice cream cone. You have good parents!
