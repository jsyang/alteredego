While having a soda at ${loverName}'s house, the phone rings. She picks it up and looks around the room, nervously. She walks out of the room with the phone, and you think you can hear her say, "I TOLD you not to call me at home." She puts the
phone back down and proceeds as if the phone never even rang.

You casually ask her who it was. Her voice cracks as she says, "No one." Her eyes dart around the room. How do you feel about this?
