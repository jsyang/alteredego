Ouch! You weren't paying attention, and you dug the point of the shovel right into your finger. A ring of bright red blood circles the cut on your finger. Whom do you go to for help?

Mom fixes most of your boo-boos. You wonder if Dad can make them hurt less. He takes your finger and runs it under some water, then puts a bandage on it. It stings, anyway.

You are too young to take care of a cut like this on your own. It gets infected and hurts for two weeks! You experience moderate physical discomfort, which makes you cranky.

One of your favorite games is to throw the trucks up in the air so that they crash into one another. One lands on top of you and scratches your forehead. It begins to bleed. Whom do you want to go to for help?

CRASH! You broke a large window. Before Mom or Dad has a chance to see what you've done you touch a large piece of broken glass and begin to bleed. Who do you want to go to for help?
