A couple of your friends have convinced someone to purchase a bottle of very cheap wine. They are excited about the idea of getting drunk.

There is one 12-ounce bottle of wine to be distributed to 15 boys. You take a few sips. What do you feel?

With the amount of wine you have just had, you can only ACT drunk (which is precisely what a lot of adolescents do in situations like this). It becomes a contest for who can act the most drunk.

Joey uses it as an excuse to snap the back of Mary Jane's bra. Billy rides his bicycle into a tree and everyone gets hysterical over it. George pulls down his pants and "moons" a bus full of senior citizens on their way to a bingo
tournament. The next day everyone acts like they are sooooo hung over.

This kind of impulsive behavior is becoming your trademark. You are developing a style that is characterized by clowning around to gain attention. It works great and will continue to work great as an adolescent, but as an adult it
may lead you down a path of self-destruction.

The attention you get for clowning around is so satisfying that you will stop at nothing to get more. The bra thing was funny. The "bike-into-the-tree" thing was hysterical. The senior citizen thing gets you nailed. A neighbor
recognizes you and mentions the incident to your mother.

At the same time, she has already heard the rumor that a bunch of kids in your grade were seen drinking a bottle of wine. She adds two and two and comes up with four, as in four weeks of no going out, four weeks of no T.V. and four
weeks of no visitors. Don't even hope for a reprieve on this one.

Of course you feel perfectly normal. Not even a young child could get tipsy on two sips of wine.

But a kid like you can get caught drinking when a neighbor spies what you have been doing. You are grounded for a month.

Your concern over what your friends might think of you, combined with the fear of getting caught drinking, causes you to act in a very peculiar way when you get home. Even though you are not drunk your Mom suspects that "something
funny is going on here." Even though you haven't taken enough to be drunk, your breath still smells.

You can't justify this kind of behavior to your family; it was WRONG. They don't want to hear why you thought it was O.K. to do it. They want to hear why it was NOT O.K., and why you won't do it again.

Good idea. Regardless of your excuse, it won't work. Intellectual sphere rises because of good common sense.

Failure to conform to peer pressure makes you emotionally stronger, but pulls you outside of this peer group. Your Social status suffers, but sometimes that is the price you pay for being an independent, free-thinking person.

Most of your friends are probably doing the same thing. That's probably why it is taking three hours to finish twelve ounces of wine. After the wine is finally finished, you can:
