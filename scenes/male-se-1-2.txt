You and your classmates are changing into your clothes for gym class. For a moment, everyone is naked. Even though you try not to look, you can't help wondering about how you "measure up" to the other guys. How do you feel?

For some people, this is an extremely anxiety-provoking experience. As a result of your anxiety, you hurry to put your gym clothes on. The class wise guy begins ribbing you for getting dressed so fast, calling you "teeny-weenie." Everyone
has a laugh at your expense.

This kind of reaction is more common than you might think. There are some guys over there who are snapping towels at one another. That is THEIR way of dealing with anxiety.

*set CA%-10
This is a perfectly normal kind of reaction. At your age, you are still not comfortable with your body and all the changes it has gone through. Although you might be ashamed of what you have now, you may offer to give your eye teeth if
you could only have it back thirty years from now!

This is an unusually calm response.

*label B.T
After checking your Calmness characteristic, it is obvious that you are naturally this calm in most situations. You are obviously developing with a "super-healthy" attitude about most things. Are you a real person?
