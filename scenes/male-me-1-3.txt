You haven't been married long, and your wife is still unsure of the amount of food one should cook to feed a family your size. For instance, not too long ago she cooked a seven-pound chicken just for the two of you. How should you
approach her about this?


Select an action:

*choice
  #EAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN SO YOU DON'T HURT HER FEELINGS
    *goto A1
  #TELL HER GENTLY THAT SHE COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH CHICKEN THAT IS A BIT SMALLER
    *goto A2
*label A1
*set PH%-10
As a result of your lack of assertiveness, you gain 15 pounds. Physical sphere declines.
*finish
*label A2
*if GN>60
  *goto B.T
*else
  *goto B.F
*label B.T
*set GN%-20
It's unlikely that you would be able to communicate this to her with any sensitivity. Your Gentleness characteristic is very low.
*finish
*label B.F
*set GN%+30
Your Gentleness characteristic is adequate for you to convey this to her sensitively. She cooks more manageable portions.
*finish
