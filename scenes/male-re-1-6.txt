${loverName} has spent the afternoon with her parents, visiting friends of the family. When you see ${loverName} she can't stop talking about John, their son. When ${loverName} and John were younger, everyone joked about how nice it would be if they
married when they got older.

Isn't that CUTE? Anyway, ${loverName} goes on to tell you that John grew up to be an absolute HUNK, with the CUTEST set of DIMPLES on his cheeks. After she finishes her detailed description she squeals, "HE LOOKED JUST LIKE ONE OF THOSE
CALENDAR MODELS...I COULD HAVE DIED!" How do you feel about all this?

Then you wouldn't mind if good old John went ahead and took ${loverName} to dinner one night, just as friends, would you?

That's better. It can be a bit threatening, but if you try to pretend that not even a hint of jealousy exists, you will wind up taking it out on ${loverName} in a different way.

That's so nice of you. ${loverName} just made a date with him for this Saturday.

That's understandable.

But, from what I understand of ${loverName}, she is a trustworthy person. She's just expressing that he is attractive, and that's probably all.

*label C.F
From what I understand of ${loverName}, she's not the most trustworthy type -- I know that's difficult to hear, but it WAS one of her characteristics when you met her earlier. You should examine why you would want to stay with someone
whom you might not trust completely.
*page_break
Is it just you being overly concerned, or is there really a danger that she might abandon you for the first gorgeous, available guy that comes along?

You immediately begin showing your jealousy by asking for a point-by-point comparison between you and John. If ${loverName} were to be completely honest, you would lose, hands down. As it turns out, she spends the rest of the day
massaging your fragile ego. Isn't she allowed to be attracted to other people?

Then lighten up.

Of course not. After all, YOU never have thoughts or fantasies about anyone else since you've started dating ${loverName}, right?
