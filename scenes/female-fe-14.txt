Your daughter has just introduced you to her date for the evening. His name is Mark "Mongo" Mattingly. He looks like a nice young man, but his jewelry is a bit odd, particularly one ring, which he wears in his left nostril. You
wonder if a boy who wears an earring in his nose (a nosering?) can be trusted with your daughter.

"Oh, THAT! Don't worry. He only wears it on special dates. As a matter of fact, I've only seen it on him once before. The other times I've seen him, he wears his everyday earrings (on his ears, in case you're wondering). He must be
trying to impress you." Now, doesn't that make you feel better?

She would be too embarrassed to tell him that. After all, he walked THREE whole blocks to get to the house. Some mothers are so RUDE. "Mommy, please."

Because you have a good relationship with your family members, she comes home early from her date so that you don't worry about her. What a sweetheart.

Your family relationships are good. You really want to trust her. But some of the young guys these days are such jerks. You worry until she comes home.

You don't want to make an issue out of it. She ignores you. Your family relationships have been poor lately. Perhaps you just don't know how to talk to your children. She doesn't come home from her date until three in the morning. You
were worried sick. She explains that if you would have checked, you would have seen them talking right outside the window since about 11.

You have chosen to take a dictatorial stance with your daughter. Dictatorships are often effective, but have one bad side effect -- they encourage revolution. She defies your orders and walks out the door arm and arm with her friend.

You don't trust that guy, but you don't want to make an issue out of it either. You stay up waiting for your daughter to arrive home safely.

${childName} senses your worry and because she is concerned, she makes sure to get home right on time. She is becoming a responsible caring adult.

What kind of chat could you possibly have without trying to pry, criticize or express shock at her choice of a dating partner? I know, you just wanted to make sure that she knew what she was doing. Do you think she would say no to that?
I doubt it. If you are going to trust your daughter, you will have to do it in words AND actions.

It's nice of you to be so trusting. Do you think you will stay up waiting for her to come home?

That's good. There's a difference between loving trust and careless nonchalance. You gave the young man with the ring in his nose the benefit of the doubt, but you are remaining on guard just in case.

Are you really trusting her or failing to watch out for her safety? She is only a child, and you never can be too sure about a kid who wears an earring in his nose.
