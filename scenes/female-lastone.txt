That was thoughtful. On the way home, you are once again tempted by the possibility of disposing of yet another frozen treat. You can:

Oh no! Not again! How could you be such a pig? Your lack of self-control will cause you trouble later, but you don't believe this, right?

It figures. Anyone who would steal an ice pop from someone in her own family couldn't have the kind of sensitivity it takes to see the error of her ways. By the way, your Physical sphere just took a nasty turn because of all the junk
food you have been eating.
*finish
*label G2
Oh, I see. I guess you just couldn't control yourself. Perhaps you could do something nice that doesn't involve eating.

Terrific! All is forgiven.

This starts a family fight. At the end of the fight you:

That was a very mature thing to do. You receive an apology in return.

Your status sheet suggests that you are not a very good liar. You are found out and punished.
*finish
*label I.F
Your lie effectively removes the blame from you, but someone overhears you talk about the ice pop in your sleep, and you get in trouble anyway.
*finish

The pop is never discovered missing, and the matter is never brought up.

As you might have expected, someone sees the mangled ice pop and is completely grossed out by the idea that he would have to put his lips to something you have already slobbered on. You can:

You are learning to be the master of your impulses. This is good practice for adolescence, which often presents you with goodies that are much harder to resist.

That must have been very difficult for you, considering your history of untrustworthy behavior. Your appreciation for others increases your score in Trustworthiness, Social and Intellectual areas.
*finish

You don't expect to be rewarded for this act of simple consideration, do you? The knowledge that you have respected the privacy of others should be enough. Does this make you angry?

Well, I'll have to admit that was a rather smug remark. I apologize.
