There is an appliance in the kitchen that absolutely needs fixing. ${spouseName} has been promising that he will fix it for a very long time. He doesn't seem to be doing anything now, but you know he would prefer to do anything but fix the
appliance. You could ask him to do it, but the fact is you really don't need it for anything right this second.

He tells you nicely, "I really don't feel like doing it right this second. Do you think it could stand to wait a little more?" He comes over to you and slides his hand around your waist. "I can think of a much better way to spend the
time," he says, suggestively.

"What's that supposed to mean?" It seems that you have insinuated that he is not responsible.

A few days later, you notice a little sign propped up on the appliance. "Try me now." Voila! It works!

"I don't have the right tools. Jim next door has them, but he's not around right now. I'll see if I can catch him later."

You begin to fiddle with a screw here and a switch there. There's a wire over there that seems to be hooked off a post. You hook the wire back over the post and flip the switch..."WH-I-I-RRRRRRR!" You did it! Who needs men?

Do you want to try fixing it yourself?
