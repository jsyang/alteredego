everyone. How do you feel?

For some people, this is an extremely anxiety-provoking experience. As a result of your anxiety, you hurry to put your gym clothes on. You run out onto the gym floor and Mrs. Black, the gym teacher, says, "What's the matter with your
chest?" You can hardly believe your ears.

This is a perfectly normal kind of reaction. At your age, you are still not comfortable with your body and all the changes it has gone through. Although you might be ashamed of what your body looks like now, you'll probably wish
for it back thirty years from now.
