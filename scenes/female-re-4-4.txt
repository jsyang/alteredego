${loverName} has discovered a very sound investment that he thinks could make both of you a lot of money. The investment involves pastry kiosks that will be set up in every major city in the nation. A franchise sells for $40,000 in
resources: $20,000 to be supplied by you, the other $20,000 to be invested by ${loverName}. Are you interested?

I'm sorry. You don't have that kind of money to invest.

It is pretty risky to trust a man you barely know. You invest the money, and

That's true, but he happens to have very good business sense. Are you sure you don't want to give the kiosk idea a try?

${loverName} decides to go with the idea on his own. As a result, he becomes a multimillionaire. Too bad!

That's the spirit. You can't make money unless you invest some. Your risk-taking pays off nicely. Your $20,000 parlays itself into a cool MILLION!
