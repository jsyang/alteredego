While you are playing quietly in your room, you are startled by loud muffled sounds coming from someplace else. It seems that your parents are having a terrible fight over something. Your father's deep voice seems to be shaking
the whole house. Your mother's piercing screams sound like she's being hurt terribly.

The yelling gets louder and louder, then suddenly everything is quiet. When you see your parents later they act as if nothing has happened. Mom's hair is ruffled and she seems to be very tired. You can't seem to figure out what
has happened...or can you?

They hear the door squeak open and there are a lot of rustling noises. Your mother yells out "DON'T COME IN HERE NOW!" You see that they are both undressed and run back into your room.

You open the door very quietly. Mommy seems to be on top of Dad and they are moving around making funny noises. They look a bit like they're fighting, but they don't seem to be hurting one another. You get a very funny feeling in
your stomach, like butterflies, and run back in your room.

You look into the room only to find that Mom and Dad are watching a funny movie on the bedroom television. They see you at the door and they invite you in. You snuggle up between them and feel relieved.

You can only be calm in this situation if you are willing to mentally block out all of the signals that tell you something potentially dangerous is going on. This kind of denial is a primitive defense against anxiety used often in
childhood. It's almost like "wishing something away." It is not that easy or healthy in adult life.

You hear a lot of heavy breathing noises and the bed squeaking, sharply. You never quite find out what they were all about.
