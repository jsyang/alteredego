There is a loose screw that is hanging precariously by its lip in a very hard-to-reach place. As you bring the screw driver near the screw, it slips just out of reach.

You can hear the screw bouncing around, and it sounds like it will drop out soon, but it remains inside.

The screw bounces out...onto the table then down onto a part of the floor that could camouflage a small army. The screw is virtually invisible.

Eventually, you must turn the appliance upside down in order to get the screw back in...CRASH! The insides of the appliance rain down all over the table, chipping and scratching everything in sight. The appliance is now irreparable.

Now, now. I can see this has been a frustrating experience for you. You did give it the old college try, which suggests that you have perseverence. The appliance got its just desserts, right? After all, it is dead. It will never torture
you again.

Good for you! You can see that this appliance is programmed for providing aggravation. Any other aspect of it is just a feature intended to disguise its main use. Calmness increases.

Sometimes the amount of aggravation something like this can cause, far outweighs the practical value of fixing it.
