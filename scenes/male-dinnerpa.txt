You are attending the dinner party of a close friend, Michael Lewis, and his attractive wife, Judy. All through dinner Judy has been passing admiring glances your way.
*page_break
She has commented on your clothing, your jewelry and your cologne. Michael doesn't seem to mind his wife's flirtatiousness in the least. While clearing the dishes and preparing for dessert, Judy asks if you would help her do
something in the kitchen.

When you are in the kitchen Judy mentions that she wonders why Mike has kept all of his attractive men friends such a secret. You sense that she is beginning to make her move. What will you do now?

You say you never knew that Mike had such an attractive wife. Judy removes a large, sweet strawberry from a basket in the refrigerator and takes a bite from it, which makes her lips slick and wet. She asks if you would like a bite
("of the strawberry, that is," she says with a giggle).

This can lead to only one thing, and your conscience tells you that Mike would get upset. On the other hand, he didn't seem to mind it when you walked in here.

Well, "you-know-what" happens...Mike walks in just when you are about to carry Judy into the bedroom for dessert. Everyone is embarrassed, but Mike has been through this before and evidently accepts it, although reluctantly. There are
no hard feelings.

Trustworthiness for you, however, takes a nose dive because you didn't consider the feelings of your lover, who has been sitting alone for the past hour wondering what the two of you were doing in there.

Well, "you-know-what" happens right there in the kitchen. It's surprising that the whole neighborhood doesn't realize what the two of you are doing in there, judging by the racket!

I guess she was a bit on the forward side. Just when you are about to return she says, "Come on don't be so shy, I was only giving you a compliment. Help me bring this fruit out to the guests." She walks over to the refrigerator and
takes out a large bowl of fresh fruit.

She removes a large strawberry and places it between her teeth, letting it disappear slowly into her mouth with a loud "MMMMMMMmmmmmmmm."

Why did you go in there, if you didn't expect that she would get a bit forward with you? Your anxiety makes her think that you are a wimp. She hands you a bowl of fresh fruit and asks if you would bring it back to the table.
