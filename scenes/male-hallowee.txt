Tonight is Halloween. Some of your more fun-loving friends are going door to door. Some of your more mischievous friends are going out to play pranks. You must decide on which group you would like to join:

They sense your nervousness and give you an "egg-shampoo."

This catches them off guard. You offer them a piece of candy or two and you each go your separate ways.

GET TOUGH WITH WHAT? What are you going to do, clobber them with marshmallows and candy corns? They were just waiting for a reason to cause trouble and you gave it to them. They give you an "egg-shampoo" and cover your face with
shaving cream.

Physically you are capable of beating up one of them. Will you:

You knock him to the ground and beat him up. To finish him off, you make him eat one of the raw eggs he was holding. His friends laugh at him.

The next day, the kids apologize to you and your friends. Later that evening they were caught "egging" someone's house and got in trouble with the police.

Trustworthiness decreases dramatically. That was a very unethical thing to do.

Trustworthiness increases. You are charitable and honest.

Loaded down with eggs and shaving cream, you come upon the group who decided to go door to door instead. What a bunch of sissies.

You hit one of them right in the back of the head with an egg. He seems very angry. As he comes walking toward you, you prepare another egg. Before you get a chance to throw it, he grabs you by the neck. He is extremely strong and
extremely angry. He requests that you eat the raw egg, shell and all, or prepare to be squashed "like a cockroach," as he puts it.

Squish goes the egg. Black goes your left eye. Happy Halloween!

CRUNCH! The shell and the raw egg make for a dining experience that you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. Too bad this fellow doesn't feel the same way. He supervises the ingestion of the entire egg. You barf soon afterward.
Happy Halloween!

PUNCH! That was a mistake. This guy is mad. Your left eye shuts down about thirty seconds after impact. To make matters worse, the guy cracks the egg and lets it fall on your forehead. He walks away, muttering, "Har, har, har,
wasn't that a funny yolk."

*set GN%-20
You spatter them with eggs, ruining their costumes and their candy. They have nothing to retaliate with. One of the younger, smaller ones is crying. How do you feel about this?

Apologies are handed out and accepted. The next day in school, one of them places a raw egg on your seat before you sit down. SQUISH! Now everyone is even.

Oh! How incredibly TOUGH you are, Mr. Macho.
