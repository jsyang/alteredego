You are on the school bus, on a class field trip, getting cozy with your newest girlfriend.

You call that DISCREET?! Of course, teen-agers like to be recognized slobbering all over each other in public. It is a way of "marking off the territory" so no one interferes with anyone else's partner.

Fortunately, you are a real smoothy, with excellent social skills. Your girlfriend thinks you are a fantastic lover, your friends think you are a wild macho stud, and even you have to give yourself credit for being a bit of a
playboy and man-about-town. Please don't let this go to your head. Girls don't tolerate these kinds of public displays very long.

Unfortunately, you don't have the social skills required to get away with this kind of behavior. Everyone thinks of you as an insensitive cad.

That's it, mark off the territory so all of your friends can see what's your "property." Don't you know that's no way to treat a lady?

How romantic. Your girlfriend is very impressed. You are a sensitive person. Social sphere and several positive emotional indicators rise.

YOU CALL THAT CUDDLING? An octopus with five extra arms could be more tactful. You are a cad.

What would you talk about? Camus? Satre'? The meaning of life? Why concern yourself with such things? School bus trips can be very romantic. If you're not careful, your seat might be filled by someone else on the return trip.
Adolescent relationships often have a very short life span. I've seen them begin and end just waiting in line to pick up lunch in the cafeteria.
