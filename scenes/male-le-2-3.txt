After returning from the doctor's office one day, your mother walks into the house and bursts into tears. She has just been told that she has cancer. It is not operable and must be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and
radiation. The family is in shock.
*page_break
On the outside she looks healthy and vital, but on the inside she is deteriorating rapidly. The doctors can give you no definite answers about her condition, and no prediction of how long she will live. In the coming months there will be
much sadness. The family may begin to treat her as if she is already gone, even while she remains alive.

In the months that follow there is much sadness. A short time later your mother passes away. It will take a long time to recover from the loss.

After returning home from the doctor's office one day, your mother sits on the couch and lets out a cry of anguish -- "FLEAS! I can't believe that mangy mutt gave me his FLEAS!" She is exasperated. Goodo, your dog, innocently sniffs her
ankle and looks up at her with a sheepish grin.
