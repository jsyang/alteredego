Your husband is in one of his "competitive" moods again. He has given you your choice of three challenges: Yahtzee, Trivial Pursuit, or Scrabble. His idea of a fun night is to try to humiliate you by completely outscoring you in any one
of these games.

He already has one "yahtzee" and is threatening you with four of a kind on his last roll. Fortunately, he misses. You need three fours to score the bonus on top and win. Just before you roll the dice, ${spouseName} says, "Let's make it
interesting. The loser buys the winner dinner three nights in a row. What do you say?"

    *goto B1

You roll the dice...

*set HP%-10
You don't get the roll you need. "This game is all luck," you say.

"We'll have Chinese tonight, Italian tomorrow, and French the next."

He can be really sickening sometimes, can't he?
*finish
*label C2
*set HP%+20
*set CN%+20
You get it! "This game is all luck," he says. Luck? Maybe, but he still has to buy you dinner. Another fragile ego bites the dinner tab!
*finish
*label B2
*set GN%-10
"Cluck! Cluck! Byok!" He is flapping his arms like a chicken and giving you little nibbles on the neck. If he weren't so damned annoying, he might be marginally cute. Do you want to bet?

  #YES
    *goto D1
  #NO
    *goto D2

He doesn't want to play anymore.

You have filled your little circle with all of the appropriate questions. He must choose a card. If you get this question right, you will have competely trounced him. He looks very nervous. He picks up a card, holds it to his
chest and reads slowly: "How many elephants were in Hammurabi's troops when he crossed the Alps?"


Select an action:

*choice
  #14
    *goto E1
  #400
    *goto E2

"WRONG!" he chimes, as he shoves the card into the deck.
*page_break
Wait a minute. Something seems very suspicious. You ask him what the correct answer is, and he begins to stutter. You are beginning to think he cheated.


Select an action:

*choice
  #GIVE HIM A HARD TIME
    *goto F1
  #CONTINUE PLAYING
    *goto F2
*label F1
*set CN%+10
*set IN%+20
He admits it. You caught him cheating again. He buys you dinner to make up for it.
*finish
*label F2
How could you let him get away with that? He'll probably walk all over you later.
*finish
*label A3
*set IN%+10
*set CN%+20
As usual, you completely destroy him, despite the fact that he insists on using proper names like "Poseidon," to score points. Where did the phrase "male superiority" come from, anyway?
*finish
*label A4
*set GN%-10
${spouseName} calls you a party pooper. He wants to know why you never want to do any of the FUN things. He reminds you that he went shoe shopping with you last week. Nothing works. It creates some minor tension between you.
