You are sitting in ${loverName}'s living room. The lights are low, and the two of you are very cozy. ${loverName} begins to get VERY romantic, and you respond in kind. She explains that she would really like to make love with you, but doesn't have
any birth control. What will you do?

After thirty five-minutes of searching, you finally find a drugstore that is open late. You purchase the condoms and rush back to ${loverName}'s house. She has fallen asleep in the living room and does not answer the door!

Yes, of course--and the moon is made of green cheese--and one day flying pigs will break the sound barrier. Haven't you played this game long enough to know what's going to happen? Well, it doesn't. Luckily ${loverName} doesn't get
pregnant. In case you didn't know, pulling out is no guarantee that you will not get a woman pregnant.
