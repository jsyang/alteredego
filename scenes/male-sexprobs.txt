A long-time friend and confidant tells you that he is having an unusual sexual problem with his wife. It seems that he can no longer get or maintain an erection like he used to.

He returns to tell you that the doctor told him that his problems might have been caused by the high blood pressure medication he has been taking. He feels relieved. Now there is only one small difficulty: you notice that you are having
the same type of problem. What will you do?

I wonder why you are so willing to write off a vital and enjoyable part of your life. Many people think that it is "normal" to lose sexual capacity in later years, but in reality, this is not so. The period of time between erections may
increase, but the ability to have an erection should not disappear altogether.
*page_break
If you would have seen your doctor, he would probably have mentioned this to you. In all likelihood, when your friend told you of his problem, it made you nervous, and you developed one of your own.
*finish
*label B2
*label C2
The doctor gives you a checkup and tells you that there is nothing wrong with your system. Anxiety can certainly affect sexual functioning. Perhaps when your friend told you that he was having difficulties, it made you so anxious that you
developed some of your own.

*label D.T
You ignore it, and in time the difficulties pass.
*finish
*label D.F
Judging by your personality characteristics, it seems likely that you are the type of person who would find this difficult to ignore. You might not ADMIT that it bothers you, and the failure to admit that it troubles you might cause
enough anxiety for you to develop this erection difficulty.
*page_break
You are entering a phase of life where habits become resistant to change, so I won't give you a lecture about being more expressive and honest with yourself.

I'm sure this advice is given with good intentions, however, it is not what he wants to hear. Oddly enough, about a week later, you find yourself experiencing the same kind of problem.
*goto E

*set SC%-20
True, that may be life, but it's HIS life, and he's pretty worried about it. He perceives your comment as being a bit insensitive, but maybe that is really how you feel about the matter. Oddly enough, about a week later, you find yourself
experiencing the same kinds of problem.
*goto E
*label A23
*set SC%-20
I guess you really don't feel interested in hearing about his sexual problems. Oddly enough, about a week later, you find yourself experiencing the same kind of problem.
