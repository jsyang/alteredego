Marcus Kripple and the Tubeheads are the most popular rock group with kids your age. Anyone who likes them is "in." If you don't like them (or their new hit song "I Love You, Blowtorch Eyes") you are a definite "geek."

You return home from the record store and listen to the hard-driving sounds of lead singer Marcus Kripple: "I love you, Blowtorch Eyes, When I kiss you my heart fries, With your looks you par-a-liiiize, Put my love on your burner, I'm
your biggest yearner, Blowtorch Eeeeeeyes!" That is so beautiful.

Your anxiety level rises, because you want to be like everyone else, yet you can't justify not eating for a week. When your friends ask you if you bought the album, you will have to make up a story (i.e, "my stereo is broken") in order
to retain your status in the group.

So what if none of the cool people wants to "dangle" (stay) with you. You are your own person. You're your own LONELY person, but you're probably a lot smarter than everyone else, too. Social sphere drops slightly, while Intellectual
sphere increases.
