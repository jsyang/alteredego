${loverName} has just won an all-expenses-paid trip for two to a fantastic ski resort in Vermont. She has invited you to go along with her. There is only one problem - ${loverName}'s parents absolutely refuse to allow their daughter to take an
overnight trip with anyone of the opposite sex. What will you do?

The skiing is marvelous; and except for the fact that ${loverName} is feeling a little guilty that she lied to her parents, the two of you are having an enjoyable, romantic time.
*page_break
On the second day of your vacation, ${loverName} tells you that she is going down to the resort's salon to get a massage and a manicure (part of her prize package). She will call you when she is finished so the two of you can take a whirlpool
bath together. About an hour passes before the phone rings. You are a bit sleepy from relaxing.

It's ${loverName}. You go down and have your whirlpool bath together, and it is very relaxing. The two of you finish your vacation, come home, and no one ever finds out what you did.

That is, until ${loverName} accidently leaves some photos of the lodge around the house. One shows the left portion of what is unmistakably a bare behind, which just happens to be a bit too hairy to belong to one of ${loverName}'s girl friends.

You lift up the phone and say, "Hi, gorgeous, did you have a nice massage...."

"DON'T 'HI, GORGEOUS' ME! WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER?" It's ${loverName}'s father. His message to ${loverName} is that you both have a lot of explaining to do when you get back.

What's the matter with you? Do you want ${loverName} to think something has happened to you?

You were too smart to be fooled. That was really ${loverName}'s father calling to check up on his "little pumpkin" to see if she's O.K..

Whether you realize it or not, you have put ${loverName} in a very difficult position. Now she must try to please herself (by trying to do what she wants in her own way), her parents (by not getting into a big fight with them) and you (by
sticking up for herself the way YOU think she should).
*page_break
In the end, she DOES stand up for herself. She also gets into a major fight with her parents which puts both of you out of their favor for a long time. You have a pretty lousy time on the ski trip.  As a result, ${loverName} resents you and
becomes moody.

You have decided to confront them honestly. ${loverName}'s dad appreciates this. He answers you with the same honesty. He doesn't trust you alone in the same room with his daughter. He thinks the two of you will have sex.
*page_break
You mention that if you wanted to have sex with his daughter it would be much easier to go someplace closer to home, like a local motel. You are proud of yourself for winning points in the logic department.
*page_break
${loverName}'s dad says, "Very true, very true," then gets a very sinister look on his face and continues, "Just about the only difference, my friend, is that if you did something like that close to home, and I found out about it, I would not
be inconvenienced by having to travel far to find you and beat you to a pulp."
*finish
*label A4
*set GN%+20
*set TH%+40
That was very sensitive of you. You feel that stirring up a conflict now would only spoil the trip for ${loverName}. If the two of you stay together and eventually get married, you will have plenty of opportunity to travel together.
