Late at night, while you are still awake, and ${spouseName} is sleeping, you watch her lying peacefully, a wide smile on her face.

${spouseName} looks up at you, glassy-eyed and half awake. She puts her arm across your chest and squirms into the comfortable spot between your arm and shoulder. She whispers, "Mmmmm..., I love YOU, Esteban...," then falls into a deep slumber.

"ESTEBAN, ESTEBAN, WHO THE $%#$ IS ESTEBAN?" ${spouseName} wakes up in a panic, believing the house is either on fire, being robbed, or being burned down by a robber who is not satisfied by what he was not able to find. She is curious
to know why you are speaking Spanish to apparently no one, in the middle of the night.

When you mention that she mistakenly called you Esteban, she passes it off as a silly dream.

Perhaps you are remembering that you have had dreams like that, too. Do you also remember how you ENJOYED those dreams? How about how much you wished those dreams could come TRUE?

${spouseName} thinks you are being ridiculous. How can anyone remember THAT much detail about any dream? All she can remember is that Esteban had dark hair, and a moustache. Before she can say anything else, she begins to giggle.

You confront her with her nocturnal conversation with you last night in your usual aggressive manner (Have you checked your Gentleness characteristic lately?), and she immediately thinks you dreamt the whole thing yourself.
There is no convincing her that she said another man's name in her sleep, and if she did, what's the big deal?

You seem hell-bent on making a mountain out of a molehill. She tells you about a movie she had seen on TV a while ago, where Esteban was the hero. She was dreaming that she was the heroine.

${spouseName} gets a mischievous gleam in her eye. She tells you "In the movie, the heroine's name was Maria, and she was raped by a gang of thieves from across the border. Esteban saved her from being the sex slave of this band of thugs,
then showed her honest, true 'amor.'" In her dream she kept playing these parts over and over.

Since you can control your hostility and frustration rather well, you nonchalantly ask ${spouseName} if she remembers blurting out "Esteban's" name in her sleep last night. She says she doesn't remember anything like that, and
laughs it off as being silly.

You mention that she was looking quite peaceful during her sleep, which sparks an association. "Oh, yeah! I DO remember having a kind of kinky dream last night," She teases.
