You and ${spouseName} are both very tired. Before you turn in, ${spouseName} complains that his feet have been bothering him, and that he would appreciate it if you would give him a nice, soothing foot massage. It would take a great effort to give
him a massage, since you are so tired.

His feet are calloused and bony. As you massage ${spouseName}'s feet your fatigue seems to fade, because you realize how much pleasure and relief the massage is giving your husband. It is an intimate moment for both of you; and he appreciates
the special care he is receiving. As you talk, you notice that his voice is beginning to drift off. He falls soundly asleep.

"No deal, that's too selfish!" A massage is not the type of thing to make deals over. No recipient of a good massage is likely to want to give one in return. You should know that by now. ${spouseName} falls asleep but has a restless night.

"Pleeeeeeease?" he pleads.

${spouseName} thinks you are being selfish (you really are), but by now he knows what to expect from you, and keeps reminding himself of the phrase "for better or worse...."
