After you get your hair dyed, you realize it makes a remarkable difference! You take some ribbing from your friends, but just as many people compliment you on how young you are looking. Do you feel less depressed?

Did you get married without telling anybody? I don't think so. You are probably just testing the game to see if this kind of thing was covered. Well, it was. Now you will just have to stay with your grey hair for the rest of the game!

Your male friend makes it very clear that the kind of person who gets his hair dyed is less than a man ("If you know what I mean," he says.). Will you dye it, anyway?

Your female friend encourages you to do anything that will make you feel better. She cleverly points out that many of the male fashion models and actors dye their hair to keep their youthful appearance. Will you dye it, anyway?

You don't seem upset by the fact that your hair is turning grey. You must be the self-confident type. That is extremely important in this phase of life. People your age have a tendency to use this period as a time for self-evaluation.

Being dissatisfied with yourself and your accomplishments can only serve to heighten feelings of depression and fear related to the physical side of aging. Your lack of concern for this superficial and cosmetic aspect of your appearance
is impressive.
