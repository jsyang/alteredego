At a social gathering of old friends, attention focuses on Marcia Brandon, a never-married woman who has arrived wearing outlandish clothes, a hairstyle at least 20 years behind the times and make-up that seems to have been applied with
a spatula.

Friends begin elbowing one another. You hear someone mutter a sentence which ends in "beauty school dropout" and a giggle. Someone else offers the tag, "bag lady in training," to describe her.

The oddness of her appearance is both comical and unsettling. Later, Marcia comes over to you and asks how you've been.

This must have been a very easy set of choices for you. In adolescence, it is understandable that people who are "different" become scapegoats. With adults, this behavior is more difficult to understand. She is different, true, but
she may also be a nice person. She walks out of the gathering looking lonely and depressed. She is the type of person who will probably not be understood by many.

In a quiet voice she asks if she can speak to you privately about something.

She thanks you for the kind words and mentions that she realizes everyone around her thinks she's strange. You have never really heard her talk at length, but you find out that she really doesn't care what other people think, and never
did. She has a very enjoyable life on the whole.

It seems that she needs $10000 of "seed money" to get a new cosmetics company off the ground. "Electric eyeshadow" and "Foundation-putty" are two of the products under development now. She asks if you would like to get in on the ground
floor. If the venture is a success, you will earn half the profits.
