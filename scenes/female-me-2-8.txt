"I suppose I was wrong when we were headed out to Aunt Sarah's in Connecticut and we wound up in Lake Hopatcong, Long Island? I said 'Something doesn't seem right, Aunt Sarah doesn't live off the Long Island Expressway,' but you
ignored me."

You remind him of the time when he stubbornly refused to admit an army training base was not the state park that the two of you had been searching for. The argument turns into a replay of historic driving errors.

It concludes with ${spouseName} convinced he has a better sense of direction; and you believing your sense of direction is superior. The result of your conversation is that you both spend so much time arguing that neither of you knows where
you are. Whose fault is it, now?

He insists it was YOU who got the both of you lost. After all YOU'RE doing all the back seat driving.

Why the turnabout? I guess the case for you having a lousy sense of direction won out. Very sporting of you to admit it.

The gas station attendant scratches his head and tells you he vaguely remembers how to get to where you need to go. ${spouseName} prompts you to write down what the man is saying. Do you write down the information?

The information is accurate. You arrive without getting lost. ${spouseName} takes the credit for getting you there.
*finish
*label E2
The information is inaccurate. You get lost with every turn. Finally, someone knows where it is you have to go -- three hours in the opposite direction! When you finally get there, ${spouseName} takes the credit for getting you there.
*finish
*label D2
*set GN%-10
As usual, you are being stubborn and thick-headed. "Was that a right and then a left?" Or, was that "two lefts and a right?" you wonder. ${spouseName} seems to remember what the attendent said, but he is keeping conspicuously quiet for spite!
When you finally arrive at your destination, three hours late, ${spouseName} takes all the credit for getting you there.
*finish
