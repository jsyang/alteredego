Even though your mother knows that you are currently dating someone, she candidly asks if you had ever considered dating her friend's son, Egbert. What do you think of this suggestion?

You don't have to be so hostile about it, but this is probably the most realistic teen-age response. She gets the message, but that doesn't stop her from dropping little hints, like, "Oh, Egbert is so smart. Yesterday he built a robot
that dissected a frog in Science class." (It's enough to make you really gag, isn't it?)

Your mom says, "He's polite and has a very nice chin. He's also got a LOVELY personality." Do you want to be set up with this Egbert?

It turns out that Egbert's mom has been doing quite a bit of talking about you, too. Egbert is not interested. It was his mother's line about YOUR great personality that turned him off.

I guess it was the "lovely personality" comment that killed it.
