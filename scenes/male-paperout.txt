Every one of your friends has a new "Turbo Power Mud Jumper" dirt bike (a kind of bicycle). You are being left out of Saturday morning bike trips and your friends call you a baby because you have one of those "regular, sissy bikes."

You case the shopping center parking lot and finally see a bike that meets all of the requirements for acceptance into your group. The lock used to chain it up is cheap and can be cut with ordinary pliers. You can:

This is easier than you thought. You ride away from the shopping center virtually undetected. Your desire to gain acceptance into a peer group has led you into a life of crime. Trustworthiness decreases significantly. Impulsiveness
increases significantly. You are developing the personality of a juvenile delinquent.

You snip the lock and begin to ride away. You are about to clear the shopping center parking lot when a blue station wagon blocks your exit. It is an off-duty police officer who has seen the whole thing. You are arrested and taken to the
local police station.

At your hearing before a judge you are given 25 hours of community service work to perform. Will you show up for this work?

Perhaps this will be an isolated incident, then. For now, you will get the benefit of the doubt, but remember: If you act like a criminal, you will be treated like one. Down the road, you just might find yourself in jail, and there will
be no "Get Out of Jail Free" cards.

It figures. You are playing the part of a real tough guy. Fine. Just remember: If you act like a criminal, you will be treated like one. Two modules down the road, you just might find yourself in jail, and there will be no "Get Out of
Jail Free" cards.

For a moment there, it looked like you were really going to go through with it. Peer pressure is enough to make you think about doing some very foolish things. Eventually, your parents see how much you want the bike and because you are
such a "good kid," they buy you one.

You have picked a very dumb place to try to steal a bike from. First of all, there are always too many kids around who might see you. Second of all, any bike you steal from there could probably be easily recognized by the owner. It is
obvious that you have unconsciously set yourself up for failure.
*page_break
You are caught stealing the bike by the school principal. Your parents are notified that if this kind of behavior is ever displayed again you will be expelled and sent to a special school for juvenile delinquents. Intelligence, Social
Status and Trustworthiness all decrease.

You try very hard, but because of your impulsiveness you don't have the self-control necessary to hold down a job for long enough to reach your goal. The attempt puts you in a better position to accomplish something like this next time

You try very hard, but have difficulty maintaining the responsibilities of a paper route. Eventually, you succeed, but by the time you save up and actually buy the bike, they are no longer the rage.

Your Emotional characteristics show that you have the attributes necessary to set a goal, then attain it. You work hard and put in long hours, eventually earning enough money to buy the bike. Congratulations on a job well done!

Unfortunately, doing odd jobs is not the kind of steady work that would pay enough money for you to save and make a purchase of this size. Your independence is remarkable and will positively influence your Emotional characteristics, but
for now, you don't reach your goal.

You are obviously not the type who is easily influenced by peer pressure. Perhaps it's not worth the effort right now. Many people say that you are the type of person who "marches to the beat of a different drummer." Do you think they are
right?

Well, maybe not. Sometimes this expression is a polite way of saying that you are short a marble or two.
