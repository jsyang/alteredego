Your best friend since grade school has been looking depressed and confused. She is usually a very happy-go-lucky person, so you really can't understand what could be wrong.

I guess you believe you have tried, and that any further prying would be inappropriate. Some people have a way of testing whether a person TRULY wants to help (as opposed to those who merely feel it is their obligation as friends) by
saying that there really isn't anything wrong. I think that this was one of those times. You never find out what was bothering her.

After much hesitation, she lowers her eyes and blurts out that she thinks she is a homosexual. She is worried that if she tells any friends, they will desert her, and that she will be laughed at. What are you feeling right now?

You can't prevent the shock from showing in your face. Your friend sees this and interprets it as disapproval. As a result of learning this information, what will become of your friendship with this person?

Although you would like to be supportive of her, you just can't understand why she would like women more than men. Homosexual behavior makes you feel very uncomfortable and you just can't get over it.

When confronted with even the mention of homosexual behavior, some people really panic. Your friend's fears and suspicions are proven. Two days later she disappears and you never see her again.

You may be asking for more work than you are willing to provide for this friend. As a result of your sympathy, she becomes very dependent, telling you her every problem, every thought, and every worry. This is bound to wear down the
patience of even the most true-blue friend.

At this time in your life, I'm sure that you have many of your own problems to deal with. As a result, you become tired of being her therapist and begin to avoid her. Your friendship eventually dwindles away.

This was the most considerate thing you could have done for this young person. Taking on the responsibility of being the sole source of support for her might have made her overly dependent on you. This could have put a strain on your
friendship. As a result of your suggestion, your friend learns how to deal with her homosexuality and the two of you remain close friends.

Although you are truly worried about your friend and her present state of mind, you feel uncomfortable approaching her. Perhaps you are afraid of overstepping your boundaries. Although, in this case it's too late to remedy, remember
that friendship involves risk-taking.

If you really care about someone, you can risk being told to mind your own business without fear of destroying the relationship.

You are obviously more concerned with yourself than with the problems of this friend. Unfortunately, the problems she is experiencing now are among the most unsettling people can have. As a result, she disappears and you never see her
again.
