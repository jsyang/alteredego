I'm sorry. This experience is one that requires a long discussion with your mother. Since your mother is no longer living, this is one experience that you will miss having.

You have been able to maintain a positive, but not overly warm relationship with your family over the years. Your mother's support is helpful, but the dilemma remains relatively severe. She wishes she could do more to help.

Your family relationships have suffered some problems over the years. Perhaps with your request for aid, your mother will loosen up a bit. At first she seems pushy, almost too eager to solve your problems for you. Eventually,
she calms down a bit. You both see new sides of one another.
*page_break
She comes to understand a vulnerable but mature side of you, different from the contrary person you were in your youth. You see a gentle wisdom that she may have always been able to provide, but you refused to see. The dilemma that
you take to her remains, but your respect for each other grows stronger.

That's odd. You have developed satisfactory family relationships over the years. Perhaps your feelings are much stronger for your father than they are for your mother.

That's no wonder, considering your past history of strained relationships with your family. It must be difficult to go through a serious problem and not have the kind of family support that can help carry you through such difficult
times.
