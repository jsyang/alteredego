While you are waiting for ${loverName} to get ready for your date, you are greeted by her 15-year-old son, Greg, who is spending a few weeks with his mom. He is a typical teen-ager, not overly friendly, and keeps his distance while
watching you from the corner of his eye.

${loverName} is thrilled that you would invite Greg along. The three of you have a marvelous time together. At one point during the evening the three of you are talking together and Greg slips, accidentally calling you "Dad." How do you
feel about this?

It was only a slip. You should be flattered that you were able to make such a strong impression on the boy.

It is a nice feeling when a teen-ager can warm to an adult in such a short time. I guess his behavior shows that he really feels a void in his life. Your companionship, even for one evening, does a great deal for him.

Calm down. One date does not a wedding make. He was simply feeling comfortable with you and made an honest slip. Even Freud will tell you that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar!

${loverName} can see that you made a favorable impression on Greg, which she says is a difficult thing to do. This pleases her, and as a result, you have a romantic, relaxing evening.

It takes incredible patience and social skills to be able to converse with a suspicious adolescent. Unfortunately, you do not possess these. Every question you ask is met with a the Universal Adolescent response, of "I dunno," or when he
is feeling really adventurous, "I guesso," which suggests that it was the wrong question to begin with. When ${loverName} returns you can:

You must be a glutton for punishment. Fortunately, Greg declines the invitation. He is already late for the "Rabid Poodles" concert. ${loverName} doesn't mind; she would rather be alone with you.

It is probably a relief for both of you to be out of Greg's scrutiny. ${loverName} asks you to understand that his behavior is only a sign that he is concerned about his mother's choice of companions. The evening begins with a little tension, but
turns out well.

Few adults can compete with teenagers for long in the sarcasm department. The end result of the conversation is that Greg mumbles something nasty to you under his breath.

The two of you begin a shouting match. ${loverName} wonders what is going on. Greg storms out of the room and you are left explaining the story, which sounds immature and ridiculous. You have let Greg succeed in alienating you from his mother,
which is his own way of protecting her. You and ${loverName} have a miserable night.

Perhaps you sense that this is Greg's way of alienating you from his mother. If the two of you fight, she will have to choose sides. Your ability to let things go is a sign of strength. The night is not a total disaster. You and ${loverName}
have an enjoyable time.

You probably sense that this is Greg's way of testing you, and making sure that his mom is well cared for. Perhaps he would enjoy doing something with the two of you tonight.
