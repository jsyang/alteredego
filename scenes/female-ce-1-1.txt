Gary Barber is an acquaintance who has taken a few of the same classes you have. He is an attractive, down-to-earth guy with gorgeous green eyes, a nice smile and a slim athletic body. He approaches you on campus and asks if
you would be interested in helping him decorate his apartment. He thinks it needs a "classy woman's touch." What will you do?

During the course of the afternoon, you get to know one another very well. You work together in close quarters (the room is very small), so a lot of accidental touching and bumping occurs during the day. You aren't sure, but you think
that Gary is coming on to you.

You are aggressive, "but indeed classy," as Gary says. The two of you take a nice, warm romantic shower together. I'll leave what comes after the shower to your imagination.

A fling like this is not likely to escape the attention of your steady partner. Amazingly, after he finds out about your brief affair, he forgives you. (You don't really deserve it, but your social skills are so good that you can
sweet-talk just about anybody.)

You don't really have the social skills necessary to make a move like this. Gary gets frightened by your forwardness, thanks you for your help and sends you on your way.

I guess this is not your style. It IS Gary's style, though. He asks if you would like to take a nice hot shower, then get one of his famous body massages.

How could you pass up an offer like this?

  #"I'M GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE, AND I DON'T WANT TO CHEAT ON HIM."

  #"I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT."

Maybe so. On the other hand, good relationships can start in many ways. Just because a relationship begins with a sexual experience, doesn't mean it has to continue as a series of shallow, impersonal encounters.

O.K., enough said. Gary seems very understanding.
