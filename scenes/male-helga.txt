One of your friends is getting married next Sunday, and you have been invited to his bachelor party. The best man for the wedding has hired a performer for the evening. Her name is Helga, "The Norwegian Torch."
*page_break
Her talent is taking off all of her clothing, dousing herself with a flammable liquid, setting herself ablaze and dancing until the flame burns out. The most amazing aspect of her performance is the fact that she damages neither
herself nor her immediate surroundings. After Helga's performance, she relaxes with the people at the party, wearing nothing more than a black G-string.
*page_break
At various intervals during the night, she whispers to a different gentleman at the party, leaves the room with him for about ten minutes, and returns. She leans over and whispers in your ear that she would like to perform a very
bizarre sexual act with you.

Imagine the weirdest sexual thing a person could do while hanging upside down and spinning. By the time Helga is finished with you, you don't know whether you are coming or going. She is certainly a very creative and versatile
person. Unfortunately, the experience leaves you with a rather unsavory souvenir.
*page_break
Three weeks and six shots of penicillin later, it exists only as a memory (thank goodness!).

This is an experience that could have left a long-lasting impression on you, in more ways than one. Many of the people who went with Helga that night were left with a "souvenir" of the experience. Fortunately, with a few shots of
penicillin, it went away.
