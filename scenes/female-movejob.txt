You have an appointment to meet a very successful man who can have a powerful influence on both your Resources and your career. You arrive for the meeting at his office with a little bit of time to spare, so you have the opportunity to
review your strategy. The weather is a bit sticky, so you also consider freshening up.

Confidence isn't a very strong part of your personality. The best you can do is try to APPEAR confident. Your confidence seems exaggerated and out of place. The meeting goes smoothly but accomplishes nothing at the present time. Your

As a result, you begin to perspire more than ever. It's too late to do anything else, so you walk into your meeting. You

That's the spirit! Perspiration only means that you are no stranger to hard work. That is precisely what this businessman thinks as well. The meeting is a smashing success. Vocational sphere and Resources increase. Confidence increases

You move nervously in your seat and flip through the pages of Trophy Hunter magazine. As the time for your meeting approaches, you notice a dampness under your arms.
