Syung Lee is a new Chinese student who can barely speak English. He appears awkward, is not aware of modern styles of dress, and is a bit clumsy. Everyone in school has begun to make fun of him.

I guess there are more important things in your life right now than trying to bridge this communication gap. If you would have given it just a bit more effort, it might have paid off.
