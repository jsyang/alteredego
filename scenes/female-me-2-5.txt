Your husband has an interesting habit, which he has displayed many times over the years you have been married. Every time the two of you go out to eat dinner, he leans over your plate and picks at the food in your dish.

Tonight, the two of you are with very special friends. Moments after you sit down to eat, he spears an appetizer from your dish and pops it into his mouth.

Judging by your Gentleness characteristic, it would be difficult for you to do this without everyone else seeing it and getting the impression that the two of you are bickering. Social sphere goes down.

Even though you are typically very gentle, there is no way that you can give a dirty look to your husband in a public place in a socially acceptable way. Instead of just your husband doing something tacky, now you both have done
something tacky. Social sphere goes down.

It is probably best not to make a big deal out of something like this, particularly in a public place. When the guests at the other end of the table see what is happening, they look at each other quizzically. You think they are
wondering about the appropriateness of your husband's behavior.

In reality they are whispering to each other, "Is her appetizer THAT good?" Everyone at the table asks for a bite, and before you know it, you have none left!

What kind of funny joke could you possibly make that would not sound mean and condescending?  How about "My husband comes from a big family. Whenever anything was put on the table, it was every person for himself." Something like that
would be cute; and that way you could insult your husband AND his upbringing at the same time. Some things are probably better overlooked.

Whatever you say to him is bound to make him look and feel like a child. His behavior may have been rude, but under the circumstances you might have been a bit more forgiving.
