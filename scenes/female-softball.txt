You are very bored, and the weather outside is just a bit nippy. You think that you would like to treat yourself to a small, but refreshing shopping spree. The idea seems like a worthwhile way of getting exercise. Although you live quite
a distance from the store, the walk should get your blood moving.

On the way to the store, you feel yourself alternating between feeling refreshed from the cool outside air, and dizzy. You stop and rest every few minutes, regain your composure, then move along.

The last thing you remember is a crowd of people gathering around you on a street corner. For some reason, you are looking up into the sky. It is clear and bright blue. You feel very peaceful. How nice it would have been if you could
have said good-bye.

Sometimes older folks get bored with life and just wait around to die. They believe that activity, fun and enjoyment are just for the young ones. This is unfortunate. Inactivity is probably one of the biggest causes of depression among
older people, because it increases isolation.

If you don't DO anything, you won't interact with anyone. This brings on loneliness and depression. Take a few more risks. Get out there and live a little!
