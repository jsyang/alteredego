Early in the afternoon you watch your mom as she tries to wash the clothes. Since the washing machine is always broken, Mom has given it a name, just like a pet. The washing machine's name is *&%$. You have a toy washer just like
it. Later in the afternoon, your parents tell you to go into your room and play while relatives visit.

Oh *&%#! You *&%#! You sound just like Mom! This is fun. You scream it loud so everyone can hear how big you are. You hear pounding feet. THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! It's Mom -- she looks upset. This is very confusing.

You get a lecture about the "good" words and the "bad" words. "Washing Machine" seems to be a "bad" word. You don't quite understand.

You are behaving yourself today. This is very considerate of you, but not too much fun. You show remarkable self-control, which will be helpful later.

You wonder, "Why do they sometimes send me away?" You can't concentrate, and not even Poseable Suzie Fantasik can cheer you up. You begin to cry. Your bottom teeth shake. The tears roll down your cheeks and catch the corners of your
mouth, making a salty taste. Your nose begins to drip. You place your thumb in your mouth and fall asleep in your parents' bed.

Even though you are bored, you stimulate yourself by doing something creative. You remove all of the knobs on every drawer you can find, and shoot them under the sofa bed one by one. When you are finished you:

Dad steps on one and it sticks into the bottom of his foot. He stomps up and down, calling for the washer. Mom vacuums up two of them the next time she cleans the floor, and it costs $90 to repair the vacuum.
