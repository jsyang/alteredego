Thinking about it in your state of mind makes it itch constantly. You are convinced that your penis will soon fall off, yet you still won't go to the doctor. It's only a pimple. It goes away in a few days, but it always pays
to get these things checked by a doctor. You could have given yourself a heart attack worrying about it.

You are using the defense mechanism of denial -- don't think about it, and it will go away. This time, as it happens, it does go away. Next time, you might not be so lucky.
