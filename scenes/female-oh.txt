I'm sorry. You have to be employed in a regular job to play this icon.

Things are becoming extremely stressful at work lately. You cannot find a single person capable of doing his or her job well, and there are time pressures and deadlines. You find yourself working overtime. At the end of the day, you
would like more than anything just to relax, but it's no use.
*page_break
The more you try to wind down after work, the more the pressure gets to you. You are beginning to feel afraid that work has become such an overbearing responsibility that you will no longer be able to enjoy life.

Sounds like you are feeling sorry for yourself. Life certainly can change, but you have to CAUSE it. In this phase of life, one of the things that people react to most is the fact that life IS changing. They become depressed and say they
are tired of "the same old thing."
*page_break
The problem is, if "the same old thing" suddenly disappeared, it would cause panic and confusion. What would they do then? Your complaint is certainly a valid one, but unless you motivate yourself to do something about it, I'm
afraid your depression will last a very long time.

This usually works -- temporarily. People often use alcohol as a form of self-medication, even though it can get you into trouble. It relaxes the muscles and loosens inhibitions. If you do decide to drink to help you relax, how much
drinking do you see as normal and healthy, without going overboard?

This may not seem like a large amount of alcohol, and it's not. You should know, however, that mixing wine and club soda may not have the effect of weakening the "kick" to the alcohol. Carbonated water actually speeds up the absorbtion
of alcohol into the system!

Two drinks certainly don't seem like all that much. Ask yourself: "What happens if those two drinks aren't available? Do you crave the alcohol? Do you feel edgy and uncomfortable?" If you really feel like you NEED those drinks, even if
it is just two, you are experiencing substance-abuse problems and should regulate your drinking behavior more carefully.

This doesn't seem like a large amount of alcohol to consume daily, unless you are using extremely large glasses. There are some medical reports which suggest that alcohol intake at this level may even provide a hedge against heart trouble.
*page_break
These facts, however, do not mean that this amount of drinking is completely trouble-free. If a person who takes two glasses of wine a day to relax comes to depend on that and can no longer relax without it, this suggests a
substance-abuse problem.

I assume that you are referring only to occasional alcohol use to remove you from the stressors around you. A popular myth about alcohol consumption is that you have to abuse it regularly to have a problem. In fact, this is not true.
Binge drinking (the kind YOU just described) can be just as dangerous as regular drinking, so stop fooling yourself and get on the wagon!

You must be careful, then. Some people plan such complicated vacation itineraries that their "relax" time becomes just as filled with responsibility as their work time.

Good. Just relax and take it easy. You don't want your vacation time to be too much like work.
