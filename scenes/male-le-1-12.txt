There is a very big party happening at the house of a close friend. His parents have hired a local rock group to perform there. The party will last until past your usual curfew time so you would like your parents to make an exception and
extend it for this one night.

Because you have worked hard in the past to get along with members of your family, they extend your curfew gladly. Have a nice time.

Unfortunately, you have sometimes taken your family for granted. Now you expect them to do you a favor. They refuse.
