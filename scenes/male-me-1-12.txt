No wonder you want to hide the flowers. I would too if I had done the kinds of untrustworthy things you have done so far! You don't succeed in hiding the flowers. Your wife asks where the flowers came from.

The truth doesn't work in your case. You have just been too untrustworthy in the past. Your wife cries at the thought of your having an affair (again).

I guess you're worried about her suspecting that something has gone on between you and this admirer. Well, has it?

Where was I? I don't remember any fling like this. I think you are having an overractive fantasy life.

Then, why can't you be admired? Do you enjoy the fact that your wife may be a little on the jealous side?

Why be so secretive. You are generally a trustworthy person -- at least that's what your status suggests. Are you afraid that your wife might get the wrong idea?

Then what's wrong with a little innocent admiration? Do you enjoy the fact that your wife may be a little on the jealous side?

I guess she's not very understanding about these things. Do you enjoy the fact the she may be a bit on the jealous side?

A nice, sneaky move. She is absolutely ecstatic until she finds a second note, which inadvertanly fell behind some of the flowers: "I hope your wife doesn't mind sharing some of you for today!" CRASH! That floral bonnet you are wearing
definitely clashes with your shoes!

Fortunately, you do not get caught. Your wife is thrilled with all of the attention she is getting. I guess there's no harm done.

Your Trustworthiness has been fair to moderate in the past (although you have been somewhat sneaky at times and you know it), so she accepts your story. She will be keeping an eye on you, though.

Your Trustworthiness has been a strong characteristic, and as a result your wife is proud of you and the kind of influence you have on people. The two of you have a wonderful day together.
