You awake one morning and in the confusion of being still in a daze, you remember...

THIS IS ${childName}'s wedding day!

You hurry to get ready, making sure all of the last minute arrangements are made. The ceremony is truly heartwarming. My, children do grow up fast. As you walk your beautiful daughter down the aisle, you can see the nods of approval and
hear the chatter of relatives whispering their delight at this happy occasion.

A few more steps and she'll be gone forever. For a moment you are filled with overwhelming sadness. Suddenly, you begin to think about the pattering of little feet running around the house again. A whole new generation of blessings to
come. You say the word "Grandpa" to yourself, not thinking about the age associated with it, just the two words "grand" and "father."
