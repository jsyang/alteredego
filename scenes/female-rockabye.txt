You don't have very many skills yet. As a matter of fact, life is pretty boring.

I can understand how new and confusing all of this must seem to you. Nine months of rest and relaxation, followed by all of that commotion, and now this. You can't see much, and you have no control over your body.

Your crying makes something happen. You are lifted up and rocked.

You were startled when you were lifted up. Mom is going to have to learn to handle you a bit more gently.

You have made your mother feel rejected. She will internalize this and feel guilty throughout your childhood. I know you didn't do this on purpose, but new parents are very sensitive to this sort of thing.

The gentle rocking reminds you of the good old days. Maybe this won't be so bad after all. Adaptation to change is a sign of healthy development. Keep this in mind for later.

You look around and see a large blur about eleven inches away from your eye. Every once in a while it moves. Hey...wait a minute...just as you had that thought, it moved again.

CONGRATULATIONS! You've found your hand. This may not seem like much of a big discovery, but it is. You will have to learn how to control your hands as part of childhood development. When you are an adolescent, controlling the
hands of others will become important, too!

Good idea. Infants do need their sleep. As a matter of fact, most newborns spend a very small amount of their time awake (only about six or seven minutes of wakefulness per hour) for the first six or eight weeks of life.

What's even more interesting is the fact that out of all of this time, more than 50 percent of it is spent in sleep that follows the same pattern as adult dream sleep. What could you be dreaming about?

A remarkable baby. Keeping calm can be very difficult, but if you start practicing this early, you will surely avoid ulcers later on.
