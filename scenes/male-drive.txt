While driving the car one day, you notice that the turns seem particularly sharp and treacherous.

Your reflexes are not as sharp as they used to be. Driving used to be a natural thing, but now it requires every bit of concentration you can muster. You finally get the car under control at what you feel is a safe speed,
when...HONK! A young man is tailgating and screaming in a loud voice. You can:

  #MOVE OVER AND LET HIM PASS
    *goto B2

*set GN%-20
He pulls around you, shakes his fist and screams that you are an "old menace" whose license should be revoked. He drives away.
*finish
*label B2
He zooms by you at what must be an incredible speed. "Why do these young people do such dangerous things?" you wonder.
*finish
*label A22
Your reflexes are not good enough to keep up this kind of speed. Your car begins to swerve out of control and skids off the road.

You damage your car slightly and are quite shaken up. A nice police officer helps you back home.
*finish

Your car hits a tree and you strike your head against the windshield. You begin to bleed. You are taken to the hospital, but do not recover. This game is over.
