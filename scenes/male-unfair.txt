You have just walked into a store, and there is apparently no one around to take your order. It seems that the person who should be waiting on you has stepped out of sight for a few moments. Waiting in the store with you is
a teen-aged boy, about 16 years old, wearing an old t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans.
*page_break
He must have arrived a few seconds before you. He is tapping his foot lightly to the sound of the imaginary rock and roll band playing in his head. The proprietor steps out from the room at the back of the store, makes eye
contact with you and says, "May I help you?"

It's hard to imagine what a neutral kind of a comment concerning the boy would be. I'm sure you wouldn't say something like, "That's a teen-aged boy over there." To say anything of relevance concerning the boy, you would have to
have some emotion connected to it.

Of course not, but did you consider the feelings of that young man? Adolescence is a time when feelings of insignificance and confusion about self-worth are a matter of course. You may have served to heighten these feelings in this
young man, and caused him to feel uncomfortable.

He's just a kid, right? He can wait. Your behavior reveals a kind of prejudice toward the young. It is exactly this type of prejudice that contributes to the "generation gap" phenomenon.

Luck has absolutely nothing to do with it, and I think you know that. The gentleman in the store favored you over the adolescent because you are an adult. He was prejudiced in favor of you. Adults often wonder why adolescents
have a "me-against-you" attitude about things. This is one reason.

Yes, that's one way of rationalizing your behavior. Yet, you would probably be the first one to complain if a younger person weren't showing you the courtesy you think you deserved. How will the younger generation understand courtesy,
if not by example? If he had taken YOUR turn, you probably would have put up a big fuss.

That was an extremely considerate thing to point out. The boy appreciates it. You have made him feel special and grown up, during a time when adolescents need to feel their worth validated by those around him. He even says,
"Thank you very much, sir." You see? They really are capable of speaking the common language!
