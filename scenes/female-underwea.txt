While you are shopping in town one day, a woman who introduces herself as a photographer tells you that you are very beautiful and that she might be able to get some modeling work for you. She gives you her card.

The woman tells you that she has just been given an assignment to shoot some models for a famous women's lingerie manufacturer. Would you be willing to pose for some pictures? The pay is $1000 for a modeling session.

Too bad. She tells you she will call if anything else comes up. It doesn't.

"Good! All you have to do is take off all your clothes and have a seat over there."
How do you feel?

Oooo! The seat is cold and you don't seem to have enough hands to cover all the parts that need covering. You try to appear casual but wind up looking like a cheap imitation of the statue, "The Thinker." The woman gets you a robe.

After she sets up the equipment, she asks you to put on what appear to be three small triangles and a beautiful fur coat. She says you will have to leave the studio and have your pictures taken (with the fur coat open) in trains, in the
library and in other public places.

She can guarantee that you will have privacy during the shooting. Everything has been cleared with the town.

You ask her what magazines the pictures will appear in. She says, "All of the major fashion magazines, and any of the newspapers that will agree to print them." (They ARE a bit risque.) You can:

CLICK! CLICK! SNAP! The photographer tells you, "Come on, look sexy, I love it, more face, more face, that's it." You feel like a piece of raw meat, but the session ends, and you are well paid. Two months later the photos appear in some
fashion magazines. Only one person notices the resemblance between you and the model in the ad. Do you:

As a result of doing that ad, you are asked to do others. Would you like to try to become a professional model?

Calmness in situations like this seems to come naturally for you. As a result, you succesfully complete this assignment and two others. You make $2200 for the three jobs.

That kind of calmness is not in your personality. As a result, you try to ACT calm and collected instead of BEING calm and collected. The posing doesn't work very well. The lady gives you $50 and thanks you for trying.

I guess you feel a life of fame, fortune and stardom is not for you.
