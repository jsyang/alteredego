A close friend of yours has been showing up everywhere drunk lately. Although he seems to function well at his after-school job, people are beginning to talk about him.

Your concern for your friend is admirable. It shows that you are sensitive to the amount of danger that he is in. Unfortunately, there is no way to help people like this. Denial is one of the strongest defenses alcoholics have on
their side. If he ever chooses to get straightened out, it will have to come from himself, and himself alone.

It often happens that when someone we care about is having serious problems, we ignore them, hoping that they will either vanish, or imagining that we never saw them in the first place. This is probably what your friend's parents have
done to him all his life. That's probably one of the reasons he is in such sad shape right now.

Perhaps you are angry because you are afraid that this person will embarrass you by having a problem. Sometimes when our friends have difficulties, we admonish ourselves for not being powerful enough to prevent or stop the problem.

Your anger only generates depression in your friend. As a result, everything you do for him fails, giving him more reason to believe that he is worthless. His only way of dealing with this is to drink, in an effort to relieve the
pain this brings him.

Perhaps you are upset because you think his behavior will be a negative reflection on you. Maybe you think that you should be or could be powerful enough to prevent him from further hurting himself. Both of your choices do
him no good at all. They only cause you to sit there shaking your head, saying, "How can he do this to himself?"

I guess this person really wasn't much of a friend. Either that, or you are so self-absorbed that you can't be bothered caring about anyone else.
