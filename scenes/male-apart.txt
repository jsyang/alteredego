Your self-control is quite remarkable. Look at all of those tiny little plugs and circuits. They pop out very easily. Want to go back and try again?

Your little fingers make efficient pliers. You pluck out the electronic components, tasting one or two as you go along. They are definitely not for eating. You know Dad will be pleased at your fixing his toy.

You know you shouldn't touch Dad's things. Want to stop now while everything is still reparable?

Your Dad gasps at what you've done. Your Mom blames him for leaving it within your reach. He tells her that he borrowed the calculator from work. You get whacked on the bottom.

Your Dad spends an afternoon trying to put the calculator back together and finally gives up. He spends fifty dollars to replace it.
