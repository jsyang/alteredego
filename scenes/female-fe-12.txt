A young man, five years older than ${childName} wants to take her out on a date. When you ask her how they plan to be getting around, she tells you not to worry -- her date has a car.

Your Gentleness characteristic is not developed enough for you to be firm without blowing your top and becoming hostile. Your daughter runs up to her room crying. Later on in the week, she sneaks out to meet him, anyway.

Your Expressiveness characteristic is strong. You can explain your concerns without hurting your daughter's feelings, or making it look like you are trying to force your authority on her. She listens and decides that she will see him
for lunch at a nearby fast-food place, but she will not get into the car with him.

*label D.F
Your Expressiveness characteristic is not very strong. You cannot explain all of the issues involved in going out with a boy five years older than she is at this point in her life. She is convinced that she is already a "woman."
She goes out with him but seems to come home disappointed. (Thank goodness!)
