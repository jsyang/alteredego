Your Home Economics teacher, Ms. Eschbach (alias "Queen Nerdetta"), is upset because no one seems to be paying any attention to her. Most of the students in class are going completely berserk. Matt just made a dough "bomb" and hurled
it across the room. Larry stole a frog from Science class and covered it with melted chocolate.

You are taking it in stride but just laughed hard when Jimmy spilled some flour on the front of Jeanette's shirt, then tried to brush it off. All of a sudden, Ms. Eschbach singles YOU out and tells you to go to the principal's office.
What will you do?

You are on your way down to the office, when it occurs to you that no one will know if you just walk around the halls for a little while, hang around in the bathroom and walk out.

You are spotted by Mr. Murray, who asks you what you are doing in the halls. You tell him that you are on your way to the bathroom. Later on in the teachers' lounge, Ms. Eschbach mentions the rough day she is having to Mr. Murray, and
your name comes up in conversation. You get nailed!

After wasting some time in the halls and in the bathroom, you go back to class. With a sorrowful look on your face you slink back to your place. The teacher never finds out what you did.

The principal notes that you are a troublemaker. He says, "What's the matter with you? Girls aren't supposed to be behavior problems." He sends home a note saying that you have been disruptive again. The whole experience was unfair
to you, because you really didn't do anything.

Unfortunately, your status sheet shows that you are developing an impulsive, mischievous kind of personality. This can only lead to getting a bad reputation, which by now, you have.

You are too hostile to protest sincerely. When you attempt to defend yourself, it winds up sounding like you're yelling at Ms. Eschbach. She says, "NOW GO DOWN TO THE OFFICE BEFORE I CAUSE MORE TROUBLE FOR YOU THAN YOU'LL KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH."

She can't do anything to you; it's against the law, right? Right -- it is against the law. So go get a lawyer. But for now you have to deal with Max. She says, "Get down to the office, convict, er, I mean, student. I don't wanna have
to get tough with you."

Maxine has a weird smile on all the way to the principal's office. She loves "assignments" like this. You don't get into much trouble. (The principal figures a walk up the hall with Max is punishment enough.)

Your Gentleness characteristic shows that you could probably talk your way out of the situation by asking Ms. Eschbach to be reasonable. You apologize, and she tells you to go back to your place and knock it off. At this point you can:
