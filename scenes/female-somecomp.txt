Early in the evening, a friend's mother appears mysteriously at the door and asks to speak to your mother. From another room, you hear the woman say that you have been a bad influence on her daughter and that your mother should
try harder to "raise you 'the right way.'"
*page_break
Her complaints, by the way, are totally unjustified. First, you barely know her daughter, and second, she is the biggest tramp in town, without your help or anyone else's.

I can understand why you are angry, but giving the woman a piece of your mind proves her point to her. Here you are storming in from another room and acting rude in front of company! You tried to convince the wrong person of your
innocence. For better success, you should have concentrated on your mom.

You were smart to stop yourself from running in there like a crazy person and giving that stupid woman a piece of your mind. Even when you are a pain in the neck, your mom still thinks you're a great kid. She lets the stupid neighbor's
complaints go in one ear and out the other.

Holding your anger in only makes you fantasize about what your mother's reaction to the neighbor was. Did she agree? Did she get angry? Did she stick up for you? This only intensifies your anger and makes you liable to cause trouble in
some other area of your life.

Why should you feel guilty? You didn't even do anything. Your protests come out in the form of weak defensiveness. The woman replies, "Listen, young lady, a guilty conscience needs no accusing. Stay away from my baby." You should have
let her say her piece and leave, and then had a discussion with your mother.

I'm sure that part of your guilt stems from the fact that you feel bad that your mother has to hear all this grief from that stupid lady. Maybe you are also afraid that your mother will believe her.

When you have a talk with her, she tells you that, in fact, she has heard all the stories about that woman's daughter. Your mother feels that letting her blow off some steam in your mom's direction will relieve some of the suffering
she has to bear.

You have put yourself in a difficult position. What will your mother think about what this woman is saying? Will she believe her? Doesn't she know what a trouble-maker that woman's daughter is? On the one hand, you wish you could
stick up for yourself.
*page_break
On the other hand, you feel that if you DO stick up for yourself, it may look like you are overreacting to this woman's accusations. You could have resolved all of these worries by having a simple talk about it with your mother.

You are confident that this woman is not being totally accurate. You guess that your mother won't believe a word of what she is saying. Naturally, she doesn't. You chose the most mature set of responses.

This response doesn't make too much sense. No one can be THAT unconcerned at the prospect of another person criticizing her character. You must be denying your true feelings.
