You must have met him in your dreams, because you aren't currently WITH a steady boyfriend. You'll have to go to the prom with him in your dreams, too, because now it's too late.

You get drunk or high (as usual) and pass out, forgetting most of the evening. You are arrested and spend the night in jail.

You and your date dance till dawn. The next day you go out for a champagne brunch. This is the life! You have a great time.
*page_break
The two of you try to get romantic, but you are both so tired that you pass out in each other's arms.

You are going steady with someone. Do you mean to say that you are going with someone other than a steady, someone you plan on "having an affair" with?

You'll never get away with it. As a matter of fact, your steady finds out that you have a date before prom night even arrives and dumps you.

Then I can only assume that you made an unconscious error by choosing this option -- a Freudian slip of the interface, so to speak. I must interpret this as a sign that you never wanted to go to the prom with your steady boyfriend in
the first place, which means your relationship is on the skids.
*page_break
The excitement of the prom causes stress, which destroys your relationship before prom night even arrives. You fail to find another date and spend the night alone and lonely.

Eventually, someone really nice asks you, and you accept. Your date looks great in a champagne-colored dinner jacket, with a red carnation -- very classy! (And why not?)

*set HP%-10
I'm sorry to break the news to you, but you don't have the social skills necessary to get a date for the prom. You'll have to pass on this one.
