The family dog has been acting a little peculiar lately and no one can figure out why. Some of your fellow family members suggest that maybe he should be given away, or worse, put to sleep. Dad delivers an ultimatum.

The dog must shape up or ship out. You are the only one in the house who can take the responsibility for getting him back into shape.

You spend every available minute keeping an eye on the dog, rewarding him for good behavior and keeping him out of trouble. One day, when you return home from school, you smell what can only be the dog's "by-products" (number 2 to be
specific). The smell is emanating from your parents' bedroom.

You enter the bedroom to find the dog sleeping peacefully in the corner and a "sculpture" sitting squarely atop Dad's favorite pillow. Fortunately, no one is home. You can:

Later that evening everyone gets quizzed on the possible location of Dad's pillow. No one in the house has a motive -- except the dog. Dad threatens to get rid of the dog.

Your father becomes furious. He screams, "I knew it! That mangy animal has made me miserable for the absolute last time!" The following week the dog is given to your Uncle Fred.

Your mother accuses your father of behaving like a madman over a stupid pillow. She cites the lousy example he would be setting for the children if he were to punish the dog without adequate proof. He gives in. Your Mom gives you a
wink and a smile. Nothing more needs to be said.

You scrape the sculpture off the pillow and throw it away outside the house. The pillow and pillow case are left with a large brown (and smelly) ring. After three machine washings (your mother keeps yelling "What are you DOING down
there?") the smell comes out of the pillow case, but the pillow still has the stain.

Not only that, the pillow now weighs thirty pounds because it is water-logged. It will never be dry by the time Dad gets home. What will you do?

She is very sympathetic. As it turns out, Dad couldn't tell his "favorite" pillow from a pile of bricks. She makes a quick substitution and all is well.

The situation with the dog gets worse and worse. Finally, it is put to sleep. I guess he wasn't important enough to you to keep after. Several weeks later, your mom admits to feeling lonely without a dog in the house and you get another.
