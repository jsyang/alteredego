a shrill cry cuts through the silence of the delivery room. "WAAAAAAAAAAA! AAACK! AAAACK!" OMIGOSH... A B-B-B-A-B-Y!

The birth has quite a few complications. Due to the amount of stress and the fact that it is a month early, you begin to bleed a bit more than the doctor would like. He does seem to have it under control, although your boyfriend does not look as calm. The event itself is inspiring. Even though you are so young, and regret the decisions made you do not regret this. There is a small amount of discomfort, but your boyfriend and the doctors make a fine cheerleading squad. As you prepare to see your child emerge, you fantasize about the events to come for your baby -- teething, talking, school plays, dancing lessons, softball games, college, grandchildren. It is overwhelming.

Unfortunately, there are some complications. The baby needs to be observed and monitored for the next few days at the hospital, just as a precaution. Although it is a stressful period for you, the result is that the baby is healthy.

You sign the papers in tears, hoping your child finds a happy home.  The adoption agency explains to you that it will be impossible for you to try to contact your child again in the future.  Still, you'll always wonder.
