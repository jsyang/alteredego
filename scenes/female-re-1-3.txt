As you run your hands across your face while washing, you notice a sensitive bump, right in the center of your forehead -- a big, red pimple!

Everyone knows you can't squeeze a pimple carefully! You have obviously chosen to ignore everything you have heard and read about squeezing pimples. You get a big red mark on your face (kind of a third eye).

Fortunately, your Confidence characteristic is very high, so it doesn't interfere with your date. You have a wonderful evening with ${loverName}.

When you first cover it up, it looks fine. As the night goes on, the makeup dries into an ugly orange cake and, flakes off into your soup. ${loverName} asks, "Why aren't you eating?" You just say, "Oh, I'm on a diet."

"Oh, can I finish your soup?"

It's really bothering you, and it looks like it's coming to a head.

Good idea. Everyone knows you can't squeeze a pimple carefully, especially right before a big date. You save yourself the trouble of creating a large red welt on your face, and feeling self-conscious for your whole date. You have
a good time.
