You have what you believe are reasonable solutions to their dilemma, but realize that the more you try to give them good sound advice, the more they treat you as though you were still a child. How do you feel about this?

I can understand how this could cause you to feel angry, but in their eyes you are still their "little girl." Believe it or not, eventually your advice sinks in, though they fail to attribute their success in solving the problem to you.
Some things never change!

That is very flexible of you. I'm sure you realize that no matter how sound your advice, you will always be their "little girl." Believe it or not, eventually your advice sinks in, though they fail to attribute their success in solving
the problem to you. Some things never change!

I guess this reflects some leftover anger and resentment from your youth. It's a shame. As time goes on, your parents will need more and more support from the people around them in order to keep surviving in this world. As we get older,
our roles tend to shift. The caregivers become helpless, and vice versa.
