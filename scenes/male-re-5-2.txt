Being the traditional type gets you nowhere these days. Would you reconsider just for the sake of a good time?

${loverName} drives you way out into the country to a small airport. "Did you know I belong to a flying club?" she asks. ${loverName} is proud to inform you that she is a licensed pilot! She tells the manager of the flying club to get "NOSEDIVER"
out for a flight.

Chicken! It's completely safe. "Don't you know that flying is safer than driving a car?" She says she's never had a severe crash since she began flying, and that was over a YEAR ago.

CLUCK! CLUCK! She'll go without you. She takes off and circles the park twice -- once right-side-up, the next time (gulp!) upside-down. When she gets back, she tells you the experience was exhilarating. You were a party-pooper.

The two of you are handed crash helmets. The manager of the flight club carefully points out the location of the parachute and whispers, "Make sure you strap yourself down REAL tight, Pop. She's quite a pilot." Once you get in
the plane, you observe that ${loverName} really seems to know what she is doing. The pre-flight check is even rather interesting.

Your confidence in ${loverName} grows by the minute, until she takes out the flight manual and mumbles, "I think you are supposed to push the wheel forward to go down, back to go up. Oh, what the heck, I'll find out soon enough." She
shouts out, "O.K. co-pilot, say your prayers, we're goin' ta meet the Lord!"

The engine fires up with a roar and before you know it the two of you are flying. ${loverName} tells you she really appreciates all the trust you've put in her. At this point...

She senses your nervousness and avoids doing anything too fancy. She brings you around the field a couple of times and then sets the craft down. You're not sure whether the experience has taken years off your life or put them on,
but at least you are alive to tell about it.

"Now for some fancy flying!" ${loverName} turns the plane upside-down, and does a barrel roll. "Just like the 'The Flying Tigers'" She has a bit of trouble getting the plane back on course, but after a quick consultation with
the flight manual, the plane is once again right-side-up.

Just when things have calmed down she flips the autopilot switch and turns to you with a funny look in her eye. "Ever done it at 10,000 feet?" she asks.
