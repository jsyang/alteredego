Looking in the mirror one morning, you rub your upper lip and imagine what it may be like to grow a moustache.

Your Confidence characteristic shows that you are capable of enduring the comments that people make when you change your looks. The more sensitive people say things like, "Have you done something different with your hair lately?"
The people who aren't as sensitive ask you what that "thing" hanging off your face is.

It's funny, the way a man's life is changed just by deciding not to remove something that he never asked for in the first place and can't help growing.

Your Confidence characteristic needs to be higher for you to ignore the snide comments that people make when you change your looks. They make you feel self-conscious. When you are able to put these comments out of your mind
you begin to feel like a new man.
*label D
*page_break
You begin to see yourself as a different person -- more dashing, perhaps, or mysterious. You look especially classy during that period before you realize that food sticks to facial hair. One evening you attend a show with a piece
of carrot decorating your upper lip.

She has to look at you more than you have to look at yourself, so to satisfy her you shave it off. She has come to know and love you without the moustache. With the moustache you are like a stranger to her.

She has no right to tell you what to do with your face. She feels that the moustache makes you a stranger to her. She can't get used to it. As a result, your sex life suffers.

LOVES it. She says it makes you look more like a handsome stranger. She makes believe that she is having an affair with a new, exciting lover. She attacks you wildly and can't get enough of you in bed. Pretty good, eh?
*page_break
You could really get used to this, except for the question that keeps gnawing at the back of your mind: "What was wrong with the old lover?" Moustaches are strange things...

How will you know unless you try? Have you no sense of adventure? Oh, well, maybe some other time. Just forget about Clark Gable, Burt Reynolds, Tom Selleck, Sam Nelson, and all of the other sex symbols who sport a fuzzy
upper lip.
