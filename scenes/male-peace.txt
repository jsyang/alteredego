A Peace Corps representative tells you that you would be spending a portion of your life working in one of any number of settings. The task that seems right for you is working in an agricultural community in an underdeveloped nation.
There will be very few if any economic rewards.

As a matter of fact, you will probably lose out financially because of what you could have been earning in a more traditional job in this country during the same time period. What you will lack in monetary reimbursement, you will more
than make up for in emotionally satisfying experiences and the knowledge that you have devoted a small portion of your life to helping others.

Before you volunteer, your qualifications would have to be checked. Are you interested in joining?
