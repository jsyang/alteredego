After you pay Madame Natasha an additional $1000, she waves her arms in the air and puts herself in a trance. "Lamina, samina, humina, humina, make the vorces disappear ent brink the next sucker, I mean customer, in here." Thank you

Good thinkink. At $100 you were just a bit gullible. At 200 dollars, you were a sucker. At $1000 Madame Natasha could have set you up in a condo right near the Florida Everglades.

Too bad. Now the "vorces" will bring you bad luck. That's the way it goes, I guess. On the way out of the room you trip over a loose floorboard. Madame Natasha yells, "This eez only the beginnink, dahlink!"
