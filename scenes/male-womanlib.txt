This icon represents an experience that one would have in a steady interpersonal relationship. This kind of relationship doesn't exist for you at this time, which is neither good nor bad. Please realize, however, that this condition does
lock you out of a part of human experience at this age and station in life.

Mary Lou Stoker is a friend of your closest female companion, and a staunch feminist. The truth is that she is not a feminist in the true sense of the word. She simply despises and resents men, misapplying the feminist philosophy to suit
her needs.
*page_break
One afternoon, you overhear Mary Lou telling your lover that "...he (meaning you) really doesn't give you that much room to breathe. I mean, he's O.K., considering the rest of the garbage that's out there these days, but don't you feel a
little trapped here in the same place day in and day out? What do you do together that's so exciting, anyway?"

"REAL TOUGH MACHO MAN...YEAH, REAL TOUGH," Mary Lou goads you on. "Go ahead. Why don't you beat me up? Knock me around a little bit...you're so tough!" You proved her point by letting your anger get the better of you.

No need to go for a walk now. Your partner has heaved Mary Lou out the door. No one is going to talk about you like that and get away with it!

Too late. Your partner beats you to it. She throws Mary Lou out the door and dismisses her as a nut.

Your lover tells you that even someone with ideas as strong as Mary Lou's should be allowed to air them in public. You are now in a very difficult position. You are furious. If you blow your stack, you will prove that Mary Lou is correct
-- all men are Neanderthals. Still, you resent your partner for not dismissing her as a nut and confirming her devotion to you.

Big mistake. She tells you that men have a tendency to think all women are exactly alike. She has a mind of her own. Mary Lou told her things that she can agree or disagree with of her own free will.
*page_break
By pushing too hard, you are allowing Mary Lou's accusations about men to hold more weight than they may deserve. Right now, you ARE acting unfairly, because you are being too immature to let your partner decide her feelings for herself.

This is a very honest expression of your feelings. Perhaps you are feeling a bit insecure, maybe even a bit guilty. The fact is that she DID disagree with Mary Lou, but didn't feel as if she needed to make a big deal out of it. Your
partner tells you that she thinks Mary Lou is off her rocker. You're tops in her book.

Since you are feeling so strongly, but have decided to say nothing, it is likely that this issue will continue to bother you long after the incident has passed. This is the stuff divorces and other untimely breakups are made of.

Expressiveness rises sharply. This was a very assertive way of expressing your feelings without any misplaced anger. You have a right to feel resentful. Your partner can sense you're upset and makes you aware that she has never really taken
Mary Lou too seriously.

Quite true, but considering the fact that you are angry, you would be more likely to store some of that anger as resentment if you don't express your feelings. Incidents like this can really ruin a relationship.

This response suggests a great deal of confidence on your part. You are absolutely right -- protesting too much WILL prove her point. On the other hand, not talking about any resentment you may be feeling can work against your
relationship. Would you like to change your mind and have a discussion about it?
