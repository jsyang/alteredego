While socializing at a friend's party, you run into someone you had a terrible crush on in 5th grade. He looks even better now than he did back then. He is with someone who looks bored. (She is just standing there, picking her teeth with
one of those fancy toothpicks.)

Oddly enough, HE walks over to YOU and begins a conversation about "the old days."

You are introduced to Debbie, his date, who excuses herself to look for something to eat.

You talk about how things have changed and how everyone has "grown up" since grade school. Neither of you has kept up with anyone. The conversation soon runs out of steam and you excuse yourself. Besides, Debbie has returned and
is whining about wanting to go home or go to a REAL party.

As the sweat dampens your palms, you take the risk of telling him that back in grade school you thought he was irresistable. You tell him that you wrote his name all over your arm and didn't wash it for a week.

He admits that he had quite an impression of you, too. Everyone used to call you "Chipmunk Cheeks" because of the way your teeth were too big for your mouth. He continues, "Everyone thought you were so CUTE."

Debbie returns. "Can we go home NOW?" she whines. What a disappointment.

He admits that he remembers you well too. He used to torture himself at night trying to think of things to say to you in the hall but was afraid that you would laugh at him. He says, "Sometimes I thought I would have to kill myself just
to get you to notice me."

He quickly stuffs the telephone number in his pocket.

Isn't there the small matter of a commitment that you have made to someone else that you seem to be forgetting? What do you have to say about this?

That's not very trustworthy of you. As it turns out, he never calls. Six months later, you find out that he and Debbie are married and there is a child on the way. What a waste!

How flattering. You walk away thinking about how things might have been if only you had known him back then, when things weren't so complicated.
