On the back of an old matchbook cover you see an offer which promises you the possibility of a free art scholarship if you can draw "Winnie," a cartoon figure on the inside flap.

At your age you are still naive enough to believe that things like this are indeed posible. You draw a freehand rendition of Winnie in earnest and receive an impressive-looking packet of materials from the International Institute of
Constructive Creative Painting and Art.
*page_break
It says that you have all of the qualifications of a fine artist and can enroll in their in-home study course immediately. Tuition to the Institute is, of course, completely waived because of your scholarship.
*page_break
The cost of tools and materials is $999.99 (plus state sales tax where applicable). Your parents are willing to pass up on this marvelous opportunity, but you can't quite understand why.

Your picture is returned with an offer to enroll in a home study course sponsored by the International Institute of Constructive Creative Painting and Art. Tuition is, of course, waived because you qualify for a FULL
SCHOLARSHIP.  There is a $999.99 (plus State sales tax where applicable) fee for "tools and materials." Are you interested in purchasing these materials?

Congratulations! You just paid almost $1000 for a large pack of crayons and some blank paper. You have been fooled by a very thinly-disguised sham. Intellectual sphere drops significantly (as well as money!).

You don't have enough money to do this!

You really had me worried for a minute. Your "tools and materials" would have consisted of nothing more than a fancy box of crayons and some drawing pads.

You're not going to be fooled by this old sham. Your drawing of "Winnie" usually entitles you to nothing more than a first class ride on the bus to Sucker City.
