Sometimes it is difficult to start every day cheerfully in this phase of life. You may be upset because you experience limitations on some of the things you can do. Look at the bright side: in many ways life is simpler and more
stress-free than it has been in the past. In reality, there are very few things that you cannot do. You can still do just about anything you want, it just takes longer.
