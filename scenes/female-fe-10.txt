When ${childName} arrives home late on a Saturday night, you notice the strong smell of alcohol as your young teenager walks by you.

${childName} denies every suggestion, question and out-and-out accusation you make about drinking. Any kind of calm discussion is fruitless.

I hate to bring it up, but how can you expect your child to know any kind of limits with alcohol when you have set such a poor example.

It must seem peculiar to you, since you were never much of a big drinker, yourself. Peer pressure to drink and take drugs is very strong nowadays. It would be wise of you to sit down with your child and have a long talk
when things are a bit calmer in the morning.

The next day, you confront ${childName}. Things are a bit more clear for your teenager now than last night.

You have developed good relationships with your family now and in the past. ${childName} can't help but tell you the truth about last night (a bunch of the kids had a bottle of wine...). Even though you couldn't prevent your child from
getting drunk and possibly into serious trouble, you have a positive talk that keeps communication lines open.

Perhaps you would like to make believe that you never saw it at all. This kind of denial can be very dangerous. Your Familial sphere has taken a large fall.
