You are shopping at a drug store. It is almost closing time. The manager is letting the customers out one by one, keeping the door locked so no one else can come in. Suddenly, the man in front of you at the cash register
takes out a gun and announces a holdup. He smells heavily of alcohol, and it looks as if the gun could be fake.

The gun IS fake, but there is no way for you to know that. He leaves the store and is apprehended by the police about ten minutes later. No one is hurt.

You move solely on instinct. You attempt to wrestle the gun from his hand. As you thought, it is a fake. He is easily subdued. You acted bravely, but impulsively.

He is drunk and the gun IS fake.  You are suprised at how easy he is to subdue. You don't realize your own strength. As you wrestle with him, you hit him in the nose and break it. He is a pitiful character who begins to cry before the
police arrive.
