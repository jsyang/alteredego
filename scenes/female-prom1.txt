You must have met him in your dreams, because you aren't currently WITH a steady boyfriend. You'll have to go to the prom with him in your dreams too, because now it's too late.

You are going steady with someone. Do you mean to say that you are going with someone other than a steady, someone you plan on "having an affair" with?

You'll never get away with it. As a matter of fact, your steady finds out that you've been looking to stiff him and dumps you before prom night even arrives.

Then I can only assume that you made an unconscious error by choosing this option -- a Freudian slip of the interface, so to speak. I must interpret this as a sign that you never wanted to go to the prom with your steady
boyfriend in the first place, which means your relationship is on the skids.
*page_break
The excitement of the prom causes stress which destroys your relationship before prom night even arrives. You fail to find another date and spend the night alone and lonely.

*label G.F
The guys practically line up to ask you to be their prom date. Guys you've never seen before are scrambling for your attention. Your date looks foxy in a sexy, black, European-cut tuxedo.

*if SC<40
  *goto J.T

*set CN%-10
I'm sorry to break the news to you, but you don't have the social skills necessary to get a date for the prom. You'll have to pass on this one.
