You are in a large department store with your mother and her friend. It is so crowded that all you can see is a forest of tall, grown-up legs. Your mother lets go of you so that she can feel the material of a dress she wants to buy.
Everything is buzzing. Look! The TOY department.

You can't be a real child. No real child could resist this temptation. Besides, your mother will be able to see you perfectly well from where she is standing.

A good idea, but it doesn't seem to work. You get points for trying reasonable strategies to acquire assistance. This is a sign of intelligence.

You are now using the defense mechanism of denial. This means that in order to save yourself from the anxious feelings of thinking that you have been abandoned, you have denied the reality that you are lost. This is a common
mechanism for young children, but when you are older it can get you into lots of trouble.

Your desire to explore the surroundings is commendable. Make sure that you keep an eye on your mother so that you don't get lost.

Again, you have shown remarkably good judgment for a young child. You are keeping both safety needs and curiosity satisfied. Only this time it doesn't work out very well. Your mom has stepped away from her place and now you

This is one of those times when no matter how exciting things are, you would like nothing better than a nice cup of hot chocolate and a nap. Unfortunately, this is no time to stop paying attention. While hot chocolate and
marshmallows fill your fantasies your mother walks away and momentarily forgets where you are. The two of you become separated. YOU'RE LOST!

You should never take an adventure like this when you are tired. You don't attend carefully enough to where your mother is and as a result you get LOST!
