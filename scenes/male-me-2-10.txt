Recently you have had to be put on a special diet. Naturally, all of your favorite foods are taboo. One of your most recent allowable meals was "Chicken a' la Bland," boiled chicken with steamed carrots and delicious, nutritious,
strained peas. MMmmmm!

${spouseName} has been an absolute martinet about keeping you to your diet. "If you want to kill yourself, do it on your own time!" she keeps saying.

This is not really all that likely. You might SAY that you will follow the diet strictly, but chances are, you will cheat whenever you get the opportunity. Your health suffers as a result of this, which makes ${spouseName} worry.
*finish
*label B.F
You have the willpower necessary for sticking to such a strict diet. Your Trustworthiness helps you stick it through. As your physical health improves, ${spouseName} cancels her subscription to Soldier of Fortune magazine and ceases all
surveillance operations. You are once again a free man.

You are pushing your luck. This is serious business. Your physical health does not decline nor get any better. Your cheating becomes a source of heated disagreement between you and your wife, who thinks constantly of the day
that she will discover you dead next to her, because of your selfishness.

You are a grown man, and may do whatever you like. Right now, you are choosing not to listen to the sensible advice of your doctor, or the frightened pleas of your wife. You must get a big kick out of thumbing your finger at those who
care for you. Besides, a little snack here and there off that stupid diet can't hurt that much, right?

Wrong. On one of your many excursions to satisfy your desire to do what you want, you test the limits too far. You suffer a severe attack while you are out which ultimately kills you. ${spouseName} is out of the house herself, when the police
call with the news.
*page_break
She is informed of your death by a neighbor. Her reaction is severe enough to require hospitalization and tranquilizers. Your death is met with mixed emotions by all. There is much sadness at the loss, but tremendous anger at
your stubborn carelessness. This game is over.
