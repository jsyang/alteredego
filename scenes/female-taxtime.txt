Your accountant suggests some "creative accounting" techniques that are guaranteed to reduce the amount of money you will be giving Uncle Sam this year. The techniques have one minor disadvantage -- they are in that grey area
of accounting practices that fall dangerously close to being (heaven forbid!) illegal.
*page_break
How grey the area is depends on the skill of your accountant, your willingness to see things his way, and the probability that your tax return will be flagged for an audit. It's April Fool's Day, a mere fortnight away from The Day of
Reckoning.

This will never do. Only coolness under pressure will snatch victory from the jaws of the IRS auditor when the going gets rough. You would crack under the pressure.

The accountant tells you that, unless you're willing to take the plunge with the right attitude, you're just not his kind of client. You wind up going the safe route. Eventually, you and your accountant split up. You go your way; he
(eventually) goes to The Big House.

Ha! The accountant scoffs at your cowardice. He wants no part of you in his practice. You are not "progressive" enough for him. Eventually, the two of you go your separate ways. You travel down the straight and narrow path; he
travels down the path leading to The Big House.

Bravo! That's the spirit! How aggressively do you want the accountant to pursue the Quest For Refund?

You take a risk that pays off. You are audited, but the accounting principles employed hold up under scrutiny (and some fast talking).

You are almost immediately flagged for an audit. The IRS agent is pleasant but skeptical (to say the least).

You have a confident air that shows through during the audit. The accounting principles are shaky, but the presentation given by you and your accountant is crisp, clean and to the point. Congratulations! You keep the tax savings!
