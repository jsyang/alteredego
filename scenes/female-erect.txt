blood.

I guess that your mother hasn't really been that supportive or comfortable with things like this. That's too bad. It often helps to have the support of someone close to you, when you first begin menstruating. Even if you know what's
going on from school or from friends, it can be scary and confusing.

difficult. It's like walking into a house that you've known for years and finding all of the comfortable furniture has been replaced by new pieces.
