At a party, you meet a group of people who are into the "artsy" side of life. They are extremely analytical people who express themselves creatively. Some are artists, others dancers, some self-styled "Renaissance People." They are
apolitical, non-materialistic, and consider the best decisions ones made on the spur of the moment. They are certainly different.

Some people would be stimulated by such free-spirited individuals. Maybe your boredom stems from the fact that you actually feel threatened by people who are so vastly different from yourself.
