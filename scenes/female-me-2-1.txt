Late at night, while you are still awake, and ${spouseName} is sleeping, you watch him dozing peacefully, a wide smile on his face.

${spouseName} looks up at you, glassy-eyed and half-awake. He puts his arm across your chest and squirms into the comfortable spot between your arm and shoulder. He whispers, "Mmmmm..., I love YOU, Conchetta...," then falls into a deep slumber.

"CONCHETTA, CONCHETTA, WHO THE $%#$ IS CONCHETTA?" ${spouseName} wakes up in a panic, believing the house is either on fire, being robbed or being burned down by a robber who is not satisfied by what he was not able to find. He is curious to know
why you are speaking Spanish to apparently no one, in the middle of the night.

When you mention that he mistakenly called you Conchetta, he passes it off as a silly dream.

Perhaps you are remembering that you have had dreams like that, too. Do you also remember how you ENJOYED those dreams? How about how much you wished those dreams could come TRUE?

${spouseName} thinks you are being ridiculous. How can anyone remember THAT much detail about any dream? All he can remember is that Conchetta had dark hair and a "mysterious" birthmark. Before he can say anything else, he begins to smile.

You confront him with his nocturnal conversation with you last night in your usual aggressive manner (Have you checked your Gentleness characteristic lately?), and he immediately thinks you dreamt the whole thing yourself. There is no
convincing him that he said another woman's name in his sleep, and if he did, what's the big deal?

You seem hell-bent on making a mountain out of a molehill. He tells you about a movie he saw on TV a while ago, where Conchetta was abducted by a mad group of dessert ruffians. He dreamt that he was the hero.

${spouseName} gets a mischievous gleam in his eye. He tells you, "In the movie, Conchetta was raped by a gang of thieves from across the border. A tall dark stranger saved her from being the sex slave of this band of thugs. Together, they found,
true 'amor.'" The dream kept repeating itself over and over, like reruns.

Since you can control your hostility and frustration rather well, you nonchalantly ask ${spouseName} if he remembers blurting out "Conchetta" in his sleep last night. He says he doesn't remember anything like that and laughs it off as being silly.
*page_break
You mention that he was looking quite peaceful during his sleep, which sparks an association. "Oh, yeah! I DO remember having a kind of kinky dream last night," he teases.
