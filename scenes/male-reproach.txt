I'm sorry. This experience requires a long discussion with your father. Since your father is no longer living, this is one experience that you will miss.

You are in the midst of a very difficult decision. One that has you feeling anxious and confused. The thought crosses your mind that your father might be able to give you some assistance in coming to a decision.

You've been able to maintain good family relationships over the years. Now you will begin to see the payoff. The bonds you have developed give you a strong system of support. Your dilemma vanishes with some simple wisdom shared with you
by your father. Your life spheres improve across the board.

You have been able to maintain a positive, but not overly warm relationship with your family over the years. Your father's support is helpful, but the dilemma remains relatively severe. He wishes he could do more to help.

Your family relationships have suffered some problems over the years. Perhaps with your request for aid, your father will loosen up a bit. At first, he seems pushy, almost too eager to solve your problems for you. Eventually, he calms
down a bit. You both see new sides of one another.
*page_break
He comes to understand a vulnerable but mature side of you, different from the wise-cracking, overly independent person he knew in your youth. You see a gentle wisdom that he may have always been able to provide, but you refused to see.
The dilemma that you take to him remains, but your respect for each other grows stronger.

That's odd. It seems that you have developed satisfactory family relationships over the years. Perhaps your feelings are much stronger for your mother than they are for your father.

That's no wonder, considering your past history of strained relationships with your family. It must be difficult to go through a serious problem and not have the kind of family support that can help carry you through such difficult times.
