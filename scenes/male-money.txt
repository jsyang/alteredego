A relative whom you haven't seen in many years calls you up on the phone with a hard-luck story. He needs approximately $10000 in order to keep his house. You have heard that he has certain "bad habits," though when he speaks with you
he sounds decent enough. Perhaps he really has fallen on hard times. He appeals to you for the loan, which he assures you he will repay within the year.

Your generosity is appreciated, but you don't have the money to lend!

You ARE very generous, but also a bit naive. As you discover, if you had a dollar for every excuse he comes up with, you would have been repaid. Unfortunately, you get only the excuses, not the cash. You must have had
some fantasy that he might strike it rich and repay you doubly or triply. Some fantasies can get very expensive.

I guess you think it is wisest to play it safe. Good idea. This episode could only have spelled trouble.

You say, "I know how tough it is" but don't fork over the cash. This makes your relative angry with you. He storms out of the house saying he doesn't need any of your charity.
