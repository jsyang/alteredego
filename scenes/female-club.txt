Your Physical sphere shows that you are in decent shape. There probably won't be any serious short-term consequences, but that doesn't mean you can neglect yourself, either.

Chances are, you are less active during this phase of life than when you were younger. You have been fortunate enough to avoid anything serious thus far. Your Physical sphere shows that your health is declining. Be careful.

I'm sorry. You don't have enough resources to join a health club. You will just have to do sit-ups in your living room for now.

After a week of sweating and toiling, you feel worse than when you began. Do you honestly think you can keep up with this?

You haven't taken this very seriously, have you? If you don't keep in shape, you are likely to suffer physically. You probably won't see the effects of an exercise program like this for a month or two, especially at your age.

It's not very likely that you will, considering the fact that you are the impulsive type, and impulsive people generally don't stick to things very long. One of the ways you can discipline yourself is by joining an aerobics class. Would
you care to sign up for Steve's Early Evening Tummy Toner Class?

The class is full of women at least fifteen years your junior. They make you a bit self-conscious. Steve, however is a HUNK! Getting in shape might be more fun than you think! At the end of a six-week program, your body looks terrific.

Too bad. You should have seen Steve. What a HUNK!

Since you have decided not to take the class, you begin your own work-out program in earnest, but because of your poor impulse control, you stop before any long-term benefits can be achieved.

You certainly have the self-discipline needed for sticking to a rigorous exercise program. How about joining a nice aerobics class to get your heart in shape?

I guess you are the type that wants to get the job done alone. You are missing out on Steve's Early Evening Tummy Toner program at the club. Steve is a tall muscular fellow who wears flimsy gym shorts and cut athletic shirts. Are you
sure you don't want to sign up?

O.K., suit yourself. You are good enough to stick to it without the incentive. Because of your perseverance, your Physical Sphere takes a remarkable jump. You are now in excellent physical shape.

I'm sorry. When all your friends found out about Steve, the class filled up practically overnight. Your perseverance and desire to get in shape pays off in other ways. Your Physical sphere rises sharply.
