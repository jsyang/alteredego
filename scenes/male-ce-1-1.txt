Perri Barber is an acquaintance who has taken a few of the same classes you have. She is a petite brunette with gorgeous green eyes, a nice smile, and a slim athletic body. She approaches you on campus and asks if you would be
interested in helping paint her dormitory room. What will you do?

During the course of the afternoon, you get to know one another very well. You work together in close quarters (the room is very small), so a lot of accidental touching and bumping occurs during the day. You aren't sure, but
you think that Perri is coming on to you.

You are a smooth operator. She accepts and the two of you take a nice, warm, romantic shower together. I'll leave what comes after the shower to your imagination.

A fling like this is not likely to escape the attention of your steady partner. Amazingly, after she finds out about your brief affair, she forgives you (you don't really deserve it, but your social skills are so good that you can
sweet-talk just about anybody).

You don't really have the social skills necessary to make a move like this. Perri gets turned off by your forwardness, thanks you for your help, and sends you on your way.

I guess this is not your style. It IS Perri's style, though. She asks if you would like her to help scrub all of that paint off your gorgeous body.

Sometimes women who come on this strongly can frighten a man. The performance anxiety may have overwhelmed you.

Maybe so. On the other hand, good relationships can start in many ways. Just because a relationship begins with a sexual experience, doesn't mean it has to continue as a series of shallow, impersonal encounters.

O.K.. I won't pry any further.
