Your dad decides he wants to have a "long talk" with you about college. In his talk he advises you to do all the things you think you would like to do least. He suggests careers that you couldn't see yourself doing in a
million years. He talks about colleges that seem dull and uninteresting. ("Say, son, have you ever thought of going to a military college...")

You get the distinct sense that he has already planned the next eight years of your life for you. At this point you may not be sure that you want to go to college at all.

Although you feel that he is inappropriately trying to control your life, you just sit there and take it all in. This will cause problems later when you find out he has taken the liberty to fill out applications for these colleges on
your behalf.

It is clear that the goals he wants for you and your own goals may not be in agreement right now. Perhaps he is being overly pushy. A direct, angry confrontation with him right now puts him on the defensive. The
conversation ends when he says, "You'll go and you'll thank me for it someday." You reply, "That's what YOU think. I'll do what I want."

You are letting your father overstep his bounds as advisor. His concern about your getting a good education has caused him to behave in an overly-controlling fashion. You are evidently too anxious to confront him about this, so he
continues making decisions for you, keeping you not only anxious and depressed, but dependent on him as well.

You get the following reply: "Nonsense! You're much too young to know what you are interested in. Just listen to me and everything will be just fine."

Sometimes parents get overzealous helping their children plan for the future. They may have a real need to control their children and are fearful of giving up that control.

You express your desire to control your own life to your father. He has difficulty understanding why you might resent his help. Expressing yourself now prevents you from having a major blowup with him later on.

That may be so, but somewhere down the line you are going to have to come to a confrontation about it. You are avoiding expressing your feelings now. This can mislead your father into thinking he has the right to plan for you rather
than offering suggestions without pressuring you to follow them. This may cause a major family fight later.

This is a time in your life when you should be taking some of the responsibility for what you are going to do with the rest of it. Perhaps you are letting yourself be guided a bit too much. If these are the things you
want to do, fine. YOU are going to have to learn how to make decisions on your own someday.
