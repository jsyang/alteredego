While hurrying off to do a chore one day, you look down at the speedometer and see the needle inching past the "70" marker. Before you get the opportunity to ease off the accelerator, you are distracted by a set of flashing blue lights
and a voice telling you to pull over.

The officer reminds you that you were driving at a very dangerous speed. "You could have easily injured other motorists or yourself," he says. Your excuses do not help. He writes you a summons. Is this likely to make you more careful in
the future?

The officer takes your license and heads back to his car. After what seems like an eternity, he leans into your window and removes his hat and glasses. "You were driving at a very dangerous speed. I imagine that there are people who
would miss having you around if you got into a fatal car accident.
*page_break
I'm going to give you a warning now, but if I catch you speeding again, I'm going to see to it that you pay the full fine. Have a nice day."

"That stupid cop," you say to yourself. Driving away, your tires bite the pavement in disgust. As you look in the rear view mirror, you notice HE'S PULLING YOU OVER AGAIN!! You were so angry that you forgot to put on your turn signal
before you pulled away! Here you go again...

"WaaAAAAAa!" The policeman is annoyed by your wailing. He tells you to calm down and get yourself together. That stuff only works on "I Love Lucy." He gives you some tissues, and just when you think he's about to let you off the hook,
out comes his little leather book, and he writes you a summons for speeding.
