Billy Harper is the cutest guy in your class. You have been giving each other "the eye" for about two weeks now. You are all set to "talk to him" when your best friend (who happens to have nicer clothes and is prettier than you)
confesses that she cannot sleep at night because of him.
*page_break
She asks your advice about the best way to meet him, unaware that you, too, are smitten by him.

You take your best friend into your confidence and casually mention that Billy's father is a convicted mass murderer--no big deal though; you can get to know the family by visiting him on Saturdays. Needless to say, your friend's
interest is somewhat dampened.

It's not long before your story is discovered as a lie. Billy's father is a telephone repairman who fixed your friend's mother's phone just yesterday! As a result, you lose your best friend and your chance to meet Billy.

Things turn out well for you. You and Billy become a hot item around school. You sacrifice your best friend in the process. How do you feel about it?

I guess you are the type who feels that friends are disposable. Actually, Billy feels the same way. Two weeks after you begin dating him, he starts seeing a cheerleader who has already begun to wear a bra.

You give your friend good advice, then you take Billy aside for a heart-to-heart talk. You tell Billy that you care about your friend a great deal and don't want to see her get hurt. It's just that she has this habit that she can't
control.
*page_break
Whenever she is around boys she has these violent temper fits. ("These fits run in the family," you mention.) If you're not careful you could lose an eye, or worse. You ask Billy to please be patient about this, because she really is a
great person. He wants no part of it. Your dirty work is accomplished.

That was kind of you. Your friend goes out with Billy, for a week and then reports that he has "cheese breath." He becomes a lot less attractive to you both after this.

If you are going to be honest about your feelings, you really can't give good advice. These choices reflect confusion and ambivalence.

Your ability to put your feelings aside is remarkable. Your friendship bond becomes stronger, but seriously, do you really think you can tolerate this without holding a grudge?

I don't believe that. I understand how you can be sympathetic, but you HAVE to feel a little resentful. You don't have to ACT on the resentment, but you can still FEEL bad.
*finish
*label G2
That's perfectly understandable. You are bound to feel a little resentment. You are smart enough to understand that, just because you make a sacrifice for someone, it doesn't mean you shouldn't feel the loss of what you have sacrificed.
People who don't acknowledge this can become martyrs and annoying to be around.

Your sympathy is much appreciated, but it also presents a dilemma for you and your friend.
