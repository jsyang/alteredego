You are hanging around at your friend's house. There is nobody home but you and he. Your friend goes into his parents' bedroom and emerges with a small, yellow box. He opens the box and shows you his father's gun -- a chrome revolver.

You touch the gun. It is bright silver. It's cold. You run your hand up and down the barrel.

You give it back to your friend, who shows you how you would load it. He makes you swear that you'll never tell anyone he took the gun out, and puts it back.

You point it out the window and place your finger lightly on the trigger. All of a sudden your friend's dog runs into the room and playfully jumps on your back. You lunge forward, twist around, and feel the barrel of the gun pressed
against your own stomach. BLAM!

That's what would have happened if your friend's father had not left the safety catch on.

Your hand jerks up and away from you as a thundering blast rattles the walls of the house. Everything appears to be happening in slow motion. Out of the corner of your eye you see pieces of broken ceramic shower the room. They are the
remains of your friend's father's priceless Ming vase. You excuse yourself saying, "Gotta go!"

You look at it from a distance; then tell your friend to put it away. You can get hurt playing with these things. Still, they are fascinating to you.

You don't want any part of that thing. You tell him to put it away. He laughs and tells you that he takes it out all the time. He calls you a baby for being so frightened. On the way back into the bedroom to put the gun away, he
trips. The gun discharges and blows a hole through the ceiling of his house. You excuse yourself saying you think it's time for you to go home now.

Most people without training can't remain this calm in the presence of a loaded weapon. Perhaps you are not taking the potential danger of this situation seriously enough.

Acting anxious might cause your friend to tease you or egg you on with the gun. He did a dangerous thing by taking the gun out. One or both of you could have been killed. Intellectual sphere increases.
