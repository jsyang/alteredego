Your next door neighbors have been easy enough to get along with over the years. They haven't been perfect, mind you -- they have their faults like everyone else. One of these faults is called "Lucky," an annoying
wire-haired terrier that makes a sound like this--"YIP...YIP...YIP."
*page_break
Lucky makes his music on a regular basis, but it is tolerable, and has become a part of the background noise of your living environment. You have even learned to make excuses for Lucky to your houseguests, who feel compelled to offer
suggestions of permanent but needlessly violent remedies for Lucky's idiosyncrasies.
*page_break
You are faced with a dilemma -- Lucky's "parents," your neighbors, are leaving town for a few days and Lucky needs a place to stay.

"Oh, you're so kind!" your neighbor says, while Lucky keeps up a steady "yip! yip!" in the background. To show his appreciation, Lucky trots into your living room and lifts his leg on the sofa. "You've got to watch that," says the
neighbor, "Lucky gets excited very easily!"

Once piddled on, twice shy, eh? Oh well, you did try to extend a helping hand. Your choice shows that you are not willing to get stepped on.

Your house becomes Lucky's playground. He isn't the type of dog who takes well to discipline. His yipping is beginning to seem like an ancient torture and it isn't long before your hairs are curling up much like his own. One morning
you wake to find that Lucky has redecorated the kitchen with last night's garbage.

Lucky looks at you quizzically and begins a long sequence of yips. "YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP! YIP!"

"YIP! YIP! YIP!" He doesn't understand English any better than you understand Dog. Fortunately, Lucky is not yours forever and your neighbors soon return to bring him home.

"The nerve! How can you talk about our little baby like that? Come here, Lucky, baby, we loooooove you." Your neighbors tell you that you are fortunate that you were able to spend these days in Lucky's company, then turn and walk away.

You give Lucky back to his parents, then walk back into your home and feel the relief spreading like warm sunshine through your entire body. Suddenly, you notice a peculiar smell and a soft spongy feeling under your bare right foot.

Lucky may be gone, but he has left you a present. By the way, you've just "stumbled" into the very situation that helped earn "Lucky" his name. Isn't that thrilling?

Fortunately, the time passes (slowly and agonizingly, "YIP!", but it passes, nonetheless). Lucky's parents return. You give Lucky back to his parents, then walk back into your home and feel the relief spreading like warm sunshine
through your entire body.

Oh, well. Poor old Lucky will have to spend the next few days cooped up in a small wire box at the kennel. Imagine the howls, the inconvenience and the confusion. Pooooooooooor Lucky! Would you like to reconsider?
