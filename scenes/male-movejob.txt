I'm sorry. In order to play through this icon, you need a steady job. You may go to the WORK ICON and apply for one, then return.

Since you have no female partner to tie you down, the transition is relatively smooth. The move brings some changes which cause some temporary stress. This stress is related to moving to a new place, losing old social contacts and
settling into a good job.

But she doesn't want to go. If you want to go, you'll have to break the relationship with her. The repercussions of this are likely to affect your performance on the new job. As a matter of fact, if you TRY to break off your relationship,
it will cause so many complications that the job offer will have expired before you can straighten the whole mess out.

Good luck. She is almost as stubborn as you are. She refuses to leave with you. The only way you're going to go is by leaving her behind. You can go to the RELATIONSHIP ICON or the MARRIAGE ICON and break up the relationship, but the
stress associated with that AND changing jobs is likely to cause poor performance.

Besides, by the time you go through the whole emotional ordeal of splitting up, the job opportunity will have passed. For now, you are stuck where you are.

Your Gentleness characteristic is too low for you to make her believe you are sincere in your wish for her to be involved in the decision-making process. Your temper and hostility make her feel pressured. She refuses to go. Now you are in
a bind.

If you end the relationship, emotionally you will not be able to manage the stresses of the new job. However, since it took you so long to make a decision, the job offer has expired.

Even though you are sincere in your desire to get her input on this life change, she doesn't want to leave. This whole dilemma has taken so long to resolve that in the process, the job offer expires.

You should never make a major life change without first thinking it all the way through. Your mixed feelings affect your ability to do the job. As a result, you are told that you simply "won't work out in the new position."

Some of the stress of changing locations is relieved by the fact that you are back home. I guess you never wanted to go in the first place.

You may be thinking "Maybe the job didn't work out, but I might warm up to this place, after all." Perhaps so, unless you are not returning home just to avoid the embarrassment of admitting that you failed. In any case, your stress level
increases moderately due to the amount of change you must deal with.
