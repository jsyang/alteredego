You and ${loverName} have spent the evening watching television upstairs in his room. It's a quiet night, and the two of you snuggle into each other's arms and begin to nap. You are disturbed from your peaceful sleep by the sound of birds
chirping outside the window.
*page_break
You open your eyes and realize you have fallen asleep for six hours. It's 4:37 a.m.! Your parents will have a fit if you come home this late. What will you do?

Your father is asleep on the couch directly facing the door. He has obviously been waiting for you to arrive. While he's snoring, you notice the massive size of his mouth. He is wearing paisley pajama bottoms, and his chest is heaving
up and down as he breathes.

You are frozen in panic, but you have to make a move soon. You try to tiptoe past him... only three feet to go until you reach the stairs... SNORT! SNORT! SNORT!

He rolls over on the couch and sinks deeper into dreamland. The next day, under questioning, you claim to have been late, but not THAT late. Dad fell asleep at 12:30, so he has no way of checking your story.

After all, the truth can't hurt, right? That is correct -- but only provided that the person to whom you are telling the truth actually believes it is the truth. Your father does not believe you fell asleep watching television.

He would prefer to believe that the two of you spent all night doing frivolous, immoral and perverted things with one another (after all, that is what HE did when he was your age), and hence treats you as such. He banishes ${loverName} from the
house, never to return. Mom is much more understanding. She tells you to pay no attention to that "old goat."

You don't expect him to fall for THAT old story, do you? (That's the same story HE used when he was your age.) He banishes ${loverName} from the house, never to return, and exiles you to your room for eternity. A bit strict, don't you think? The
next day, Mother tells you not to pay attention to that "old goat."

You were ready for a bit of lecturing, but instead you get an entire study-at-home combination course on ethics, morals, responsibility and the importance of maintaining purity and integrity despite temptation. When your father is
finished, you wish him a good morning, cook yourself breakfast and go to bed. What a night!

${loverName} is already nervous enough without placing the burden of getting you out of this jam squarely on his shoulders alone.

Sounds like you are being needlessly hostile. As a matter of fact, ${loverName} is sick of it. He gives you the boot.
