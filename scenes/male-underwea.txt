While you are shopping in town one day, a woman who introduces herself as a photographer tells you that you are very handsome and that she might be able to get some modeling work for you. She gives you her card.

Oooo! The seat is cold and you don't seem to have enough hands to cover all the parts that need covering. You try to appear casual, but wind up looking like a cheap imitation of the statue, "The Thinker." The woman gets you a robe.

Calmness in situations like this seems to come naturally for you. As a result you succesfully complete this assignment and two others. You make $2200 for the three jobs.

That kind of calmness is not in your personality. As a result, you try to ACT calm and collected instead of BEING calm and collected. The posing doesn't work very well. The lady gives you $50 and thanks you for trying.
