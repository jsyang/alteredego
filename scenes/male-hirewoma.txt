You are being made responsible for hiring a new employee, an apprentice who will learn your job so that you can expand your work. There are several candidates available for interviewing: Max is an energetic young achiever with a degree
from a large university. Harold is a casual, laid back type.
*page_break
At first he seems slow, but as the interview goes on you realize that he pays attention very carefully, and when he speaks always says something meaningful. Gabrielle is a young, sexy, outgoing type with a great pair of legs, and large,
green eyes. She seems to be very organized, and is eager to please.

Max becomes a valuable aid, full of fresh new ideas and tremendous energy. He invests a lot of time on your behalf and makes you look good in front of others. Because of your confidence in hiring him, your Vocational sphere takes a giant
increase. Good decision.

Harold is a good choice, but only for a short time. Eventually, you find his quietness a bit unnerving. "What is going on in that young man's head?" you wonder. Well, what's going on is he's collecting all the information he needs to go
out and start his own company, which he does, and it becomes very successful!

SLAP! Gabrielle may be friendly, but she's not THAT friendly. It's not long before your working relationship deteriorates and you are looking for another apprentice. Motto: It is often unwise to mix personal and business relationships.

One night, both of you are working late to get a project finished. You have loosened your clothes to be more comfortable, and Gabrielle has taken off her shoes, and opened up the top two buttons of her blouse for the same reason. The
nature of the work and the fatigue have made you both giddy. When the job is finally finished Gabrielle sighs and rests her elbow on your shoulder.

It's a very good idea not to mix your business and personal lives, but you probably know this already. The temptation, however, is great. If it weren't, you would never have gotten into this situation to begin with. As long as you are

O.K., then you will just have to wait and see how it turns out. She wasn't the best business choice, because by her description she wasn't as qualified as the other two. On the other hand, the fact that you were willing to hire a
woman (provided you didn't do it with lustful intent) was a sign of flexibility.
