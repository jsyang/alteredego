Christina Farber got a little wild playing "spin the bottle" at a friend's house yesterday. As a result, your neck looks like it was stung by a pack of wild hornets. As you walk out of the bathroom, Dad inquires about the
curious-looking marks.

You come from an understanding family. Dad offers to lend you some of his "hornet repellent," and chuckles to himself as he walks by.

Your relationship with your family really isn't so great these days. The tensions cause Dad to snap at you. He says, "Don't give me that line of bull, young man. I know a hickey when I see one." (He neglects to tell you that
when  he was your age his friends used to call him "Drac".)

At the end of his lecture he reminds you about the dangers of premarital sexual contact, listing a host of exotic diseases and their symptoms in excruciating detail.

Family relations are good right now. Dad looks at you with a fake serious face and says, "Gosh, son, you're lucky you didn't get your head bit - I mean, chopped off!" He chuckles and walks away, reflecting on his own past.

Family relations are good right now. Dad looks at you with a fake serious face and says, "Yeah, those things are a real menace to society, son. Thank goodness you came out of it in one piece!" He chuckles and walks away,

Family relations are good. Your truthfulness makes them even better. Dad knows where you got the mark, and might have even been embarrassed when he asked. Even though he trusts you, he feels the responsibility of keeping
you out of trouble as much as possible.

These talks will probably never prevent you from doing what you really want to do, but they can make you think twice about some things.

Family relations are not that strong right now. Unfortunately, when this is the case, sometimes not even the truth helps. You get a lecture on morality, complete with a description of the latest venereal diseases, their causes and
symptoms.

Did you know that by getting a hickey you can get a blood clot which can go to your BRAIN and KILL you? He finishes with, "Listen, Son, I know how it is to be your age. I'm just looking out for you." Do you wish you had given him an
excuse now?

Even though parents want their children to be truthful and honest at all times, Dad did the very thing that inspires deceit. He got angry and then he lectured you. He concentrated on that stupid hickey, rather than on the fact
that you were straightforward with him. Remember this for later when you have teen-aged children of your own!

In this instance you show more understanding for the people who are raising you than they show for you. Bravo!

You must really think Dad was born yesterday. When he was your age, his friends used to call him "Dracumouth." Whatever excuse you think of only makes him feel angry that you would take him for such a fool.
*page_break
An argument ensues and you get a boring lecture about the potential dangers of the dreaded hickey ("...it can create a blood clot that can go to your brain and kill you, bla, bla, bla..."). Even though it happens to be true, you
probably don't pay too much attention to it.

You have chosen a well-tested and time-honored adolescent defense to avoid talking about something that might be anxiety-provoking. Putting yourself up in the clouds makes you inaccessible to either real or imagined dangers.
*page_break
It works fine, but has only one drawback -- while you are flying around up in the sky, your real feelings are driven deep inside you. They can surface at a time when they might catch you off guard. As a result, you may get suddenly
depressed, have an anxiety attack or completely break down.
*page_break
Your excuse works for now, but leaves Dad shaking his head, wondering where you came from.
