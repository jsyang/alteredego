At a large picnic, you and ${childName} are asked if you want to join a three-legged race.


Select an action:

*choice
  #JOIN THE RACE
    *goto A1
  #SIT THIS ONE OUT
    *goto A2
*label A1
*temp randomC
*rand randomC 1 2
*if randomC=1
  *goto C1
*else
  *goto C2
*label C1
*if PH>60
  *goto B.T
*else
  *goto B.F
*label B.T
*set HP%+30
*set PH%+10
Since you are in good physical shape, you can easily keep up with the ${childName}'s energy. The two of you win the three-legged race! Congratulations!
*finish
*label B.F
*set FM%+20
*set HP%+40
Since you are not in very good physical condition, you have trouble keeping up with your energetic child. You loose the race, but ${childName} bolsters your sagging esteem by telling you that you were the best (not to mention the prettiest)
Mom in the whole race -- you just didn't want to show off. It would be difficult to imagine someone who could make you feel more special.
*finish
*label C2
${childName} says, "I don't want to be in any dumb three-legged race!"
*finish
*label A2
Party pooper!
*finish
