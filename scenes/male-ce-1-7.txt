This vignette requires interpersonal skills that you do not possess. Or, maybe you're married. You can try again after you have had more success in this area.

You and your favorite female companion have just spent the night together in the comfort of  her dormitory room. You are awakened by a loud ring of the telephone. As you struggle to sound coherent on the phone, you recognize the
familiar voices of her parents on the other end of the line. They ask you how you are and say, "SURPRISE! WE'RE DOWNSTAIRS AND COMING RIGHT UP!"

Her parents come up and notice that the room has a very musky smell to it. Her mom recognizes it as the smell of fulfilled desires. You can:

Oh, the story about practicing your aerobics class together was very amusing. Now, how do you explain that pair of skimpy black panties peeking out from under the pillow?!

For SHAME! "Is THIS what you are going to college for?" they wonder. "How do you think it feels for parents to come into their own child's room and be hit over the head with the evidence of their baby daughter's sexual exploits?"
Their visit is ruined. They will probably get over it. Remember, they came on their own. Next time they will probably give you fair warning.

Her parents are just as embarrassed as you are. For a few moments the visit is awkward. It was a nice sentiment for them to come visit you, but next time they will probably give more warning before popping over.

Oh. They wonder if everyone who comes over for breakfast lends their daughter their old football jersey to wear as pajamas.

Nice try, except for one thing--you forgot to take your girlfriend out of the bed before making it! She is the big lump to the left of the gym shorts.

That is very honest of you. I wonder how her parents will take it....

That might have been an acceptable response in the 60's, but we've gotten much more inhibited again since then. It is unlikely that even the most well-adjusted parents will see this kind of behavior as anything but rude and inappropriate.
They say a quick hello and goodbye.
