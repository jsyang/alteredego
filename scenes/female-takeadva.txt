You are in a large department store shopping. When you left the house this morning, you didn't put on that much makeup, and you are in comfortable, casual clothes. You have a question for the salesperson, but you can't seem to
attract his attention.
*page_break
Every time you say, "Excuse me," he says, "Just a minute, Miss," and chats with another salesperson about what seems to be a social matter rather than a business matter.

The salesperson looks at you and gives you an obvious sneer.  He turns to the person to whom he was talking and says in a voice loud enough for you to hear, "Some people are so UNCIVILIZED."

This doesn't bother them one bit. Besides, I get the feeling they didn't want you in there in the first place. Fortunately, you are smart enough to leave the store before doing something impulsive like attacking the salesperson.

Your biggest mistake was to approach the salesperson in a hostile manner. You could have tried a more assertive approach instead.

As soon as you raise your voice, the other salesperson calls store security. Two mountainous gentlemen grab you firmly by the arm and begin to walk you out of the store.

You begin screaming at the top of your lungs, which distracts the other customers in the store. In your excitement you flail your arms and break a $10,000 Ming vase. The security guards get nervous thinking that they will
have to pay for the vase and bring you to the store security office for "detention."
*page_break
After a drawn out series of conversations with the store manager, store security and the police, it is decided that you will not be responsible for the vase and that you should not shop there in the future.

You succeed. The store is burned to the ground. By the time the firefighters put it out, there is more than a million dollars worth of damage done to the store.

By the way, you also get caught. The case against you is open and shut. You are sentenced to three years in a federal penitentiary. After six months you are released. You now have a criminal record. Did you learn anything from this

When you were a child, someone probably told you that you would grow up to be a hardened criminal. If they didn't, they should have. You will probably be in trouble for the rest of your life. I suppose I could say it's not too late
to change, but I don't think it would do much good.

This was INDEED an assertive response. The salesperson resents your interruption but helps you anyway. He is careful not to say anything snide or sarcastic, because he knows that you are the kind of customer who will calmly
but firmly insist that the store manager haul his obnoxious butt out of there and out of a job. You get what you want without expending too much energy.
*finish
*label J2
This is NOT an assertive response. This is an aggressive response because you criticized the salesperson. An assertive response is one that expresses a feeling (like the one you DIDN'T choose). People often get the two confused.
It takes some practice to do it with positive results. You will have more chances. For now, this is what happens:

Because you remain calm and do not display any signs of discomfort at being treated so rudely, the salesperson continues to walk all over you. It is another half-hour before you finally get helped and can leave the store. How
do you feel now?
