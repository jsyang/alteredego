In the middle of a great rush to get out of the house, you pick up a pair of shoes, only to see the heel dangling precariously from the back. It looks like you can pound the heel back into the shoe and still wear it.

The heel goes in easily and seems surprisingly sturdy. Will you wear them?

You take two good steps and then think you feel a slight wobble. Are you absolutely POSITIVE?

The shoe wobbles slightly during the course of the day, but fortunately, you have the balance necessary to keep it on your foot. You avoid a sprained ankle.

The show wobbles slightly during the course of the day. Unfortunately, you don't have the balance necessary to keep it on your foot. You step to the side and sprain your ankle badly. As a result of this, will you...

Some people never learn. The more times you fix them, the more they earn their nickname, "Cruel Shoes." I can certainly understand your attachment to your shoes, but there is sometimes a fine line between attachment and masochism. You
are treated to a host of blisters, corns and callouses.

You may have just avoided a sprained ankle. You pick out another pair of shoes that look just fine.

It's funny how people think that uncomfortable shoes sometimes mellow with age. For the first few seconds that you wear them, they feel just fine. Not long after this, however, they bite into your toes ferociously. Ouch!

A pair of sensible shoes will never bite you in the back (of the foot, that is). You spend the day in comfort. Intelligence rises sharply.

You try pounding the heel in, but it keeps flopping right back out. You are not going to let this spoil your day. You search through the mountain of shoes in the bottom of the closet and come up with two pair of possible substitutions.
