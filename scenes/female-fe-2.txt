${childName} greets you with a tiny box, wrapped up in tissue paper. ${childName} teases you with it for a few moments and wants you to guess what is in it.


Select an action:

*choice
  #PLAY ALONG
    *goto A1
  #TELL THE BABY YOU ARE TOO BUSY
    *goto A2
*label A1
*set FM%+40
You make the perfunctory hundred guesses with no success. Finally, ${childName} unwraps the present and hands it to you. It's a clay coaster with the words "I love my mommy" scratched into it. A big hug and a kiss from ${childName} completes the
special treatment you are being given.
*finish
*label A2
*set FM%-20
What an ogre! ${childName} is hurt, but too young to hold a grudge for long. Your selfishness will eventually cause you to be the one who is short-changed in the end!
