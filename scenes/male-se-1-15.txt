It works! He gets nervous and puts you back down on the floor. After he discovers you are not injured, he gives you a "wedgie." In case you have never been on the receiving end of a wedgie, that is when someone grabs you by the elastic
band in your underwear and lifts you off the floor.

It works! He lets go of you and your head bangs off the top of the locker with a loud "GONG!" That was quick thinking. Now go down to the nurse's office and get some aspirin for that headache, Ace.
