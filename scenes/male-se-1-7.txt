Mrs. Harnaur, your English Literature teacher, is getting on in years. Everyone knows that she is a bit hard of hearing. Whenever she gives a test, people can whisper to one another without the slightest chance of being heard. On
today's test everyone seems to be cheating. There are two answers that you do not know. Will you:


Select an action:

*choice
  #CHEAT WITH EVERYONE ELSE
    *goto A1
  #DO YOUR OWN WORK
    *goto A2
*label A1
*set TR%-30
*set IN%+30
You are not caught. Your grade on the test improves as a result of your cheating.
*finish
*label A2
*set TR%+30
*set IN%-10
Because you didn't cheat, you get those two questions wrong, and your grade is lower. The people who did cheat think you were foolish.
*finish
