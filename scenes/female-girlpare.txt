I'm sorry. In order to play through this episode, you need to have a steady relationship with a boyfriend. You may try again later.

In a very subtle way, ${loverName}'s family is trying to influence a decision that the two of you are trying to make. On the one hand, you can appreciate their input, but on the other, you are not sure that you should start allowing them this
kind of influence over your lives. After all, the two of you ARE adults and should be capable of making your own decisions.

Your Gentleness characteristic suggests that you have developed a style of communicating that is firm and direct. They back off.

Your Gentleness characteristic suggests that you cannot be firm without letting your anger come to the surface. Your conversation with them sounds defensive and hostile. As a result, the conversation turns into an argument.
*finish
*label G.F
You are not aggressive enough to communicate firmly and effectively with them. They become condescending and patronize you, saying, "We thought the same thing when we were young..."

The discrepancy between your mood and actions is unhealthy. You swallow your anger, and eventually it becomes resentment. This could color your future relations with them.

You probably decided it would be better to make a good impression and go along with their advice than to cause trouble. Your failure to be firm opens a door which will allow them to make more decisions for you in the future.

Who do you think should tell them that you would like them to keep out of the decision-making process when it involves the lives of you and ${loverName}?

A good choice. This way it doesn't seem like you are pushing him to do something against his parents or that you are doing all the talking and ${loverName} must passively accept whatever you say. There is no guarantee that ${loverName}'s parents will
agree with the two of you, but they should respect your decision.
*finish
*label H2
*set HP%-10
*set GN%-10
By letting ${loverName} deal with his own parents, they become convinced that you have turned him against them.
*goto INR
*label H3
*set GN%-10
*set HP%-10
His parents react strongly to your doing all of the talking for both you and their son.
*label INR
In reality, they resent the fact that their son is growing up and moving away from them. This little disagreement has become an arena where that conflict can be expressed. It will continue to be a sore spot in your relationship with
${loverName}'s parents.

*set EX%-20
Since you said that you were confused, I assume that part of the conflict was trying to decide whether or not to be firm with ${loverName}'s parents. Even though I can sympathize with your not wanting to cause trouble, I must point out that
you have set a precedent for them interfering with your life.
