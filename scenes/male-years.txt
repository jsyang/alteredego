While you are thinking about your life and the future, you come to a startling realization: The average life expectancy for men is only about 20 years past your current age.

This is a goal that is consistent with your personality. You are a kind and gentle person. Devoting your life to others can be rich and rewarding. I'm sure you will enhance the lives of many.

This is a noble life plan. Many would have chosen more self-serving options. Your Gentleness characteristic is beginning to blossom in your late middle years.

I can understand why you chose this, and can't really blame you. You are, however, approaching a time of life when "having fun" may become more of a job than anything else, particularly if you put yourself on a "fun schedule."
*page_break
If you don't have the expected quota of fun in the next twenty years, will you consider your life to have been a failure? If you see the function of life as for amusement purposes only, then maybe you will.

You have obviously become aware of the dangers of thinking too far ahead. Often times the result of such preoccupation with the future is hopelessness ("I'll never get out of the situation I'm in."), and an unrealistic timetable that
can only result in failure.

Yes, this is a terrifying thought, but it is sometimes impossible to ignore. The signs of your advancing age are everywhere. You don't move as fast as you used to, there are assorted aches and pains, and you have seen more than one
of your friends pass on.
*page_break
On the other hand, things aren't THAT bad. One reason for the discomfort you are feeling is that you may be the type who thinks too far into the future. You are alive today, and chances are you will be alive tomorrow. Enjoy what you
can now and you will be less preoccupied with your own mortality.

As long as you are terrified, it is unlikely that you will do anything productive to get you out of this frame of mind. One reason for the discomfort you are feeling is that you may be the type who thinks too far into the
future. You are alive today, and chances are you will be alive tomorrow. Enjoy what you can now and you will be less preoccupied with your own mortality.

If you are depressed, it is unlikely that you are able to ignore the thought. I can see why thinking about this can lead to depression. There is no telling what the world will be like twenty years from now. For all you know, it
may turn out to be the type of place that you wouldn't WANT to live in.
*page_break
On the other hand, twenty years from now medical and health sciences may find a way to prolong life. It's impossible to predict. People who get depressed have a tendency to ruminate upon the future. Look at it this way: you are here
today, and there is little reason to think that you will be gone tomorrow. Enjoy what you can now, and you will be less preoccupied with your own mortality.

That is a pretty good trick. You must be the type of person who can completely blot unpleasant thoughts from your mind. Psychologists call this "denial."
*page_break
It used to be thought that people who do this are unhealthy, but research is beginning to indicate that it can be healthy in some situations. It may indeed be healthy not to let yourself worry about things over which you have no
control.
