troubling her.

Julie looks up at you, and her eyes fill with tears. Her husband Bob just confessed that he once had an affair. He felt terribly guilty about it and wanted to tell her, so that she wouldn't find out in a way that would hurt her
more. She asks for your advice about what to do.

"All men are rats," you say. "You can't trust 'em." Julie has a hard time taking you seriously. "After all," she explains, "he did show that he was sorry, and if he didn't say anything at all, he might have gotten away with
it." Julie thanks you for your support and walks away feeling better.

It's hard to help someone make a decision as important as this. Giving her a direct piece of advice might not work very well. You offer some words of sympathy and a few tales from your own experience. She sees you as kind
and wise. Julie is still upset when she leaves but feels much better than before.

You offer this piece of advice, knowing through experience that you can live through almost anything, even this. Julie doesn't understand why she should forgive her husband, because she still feels hurt and betrayed. Once you
suggest that she should forgive him, she begins to realize that he didn't want her to be hurt and that he was honest. She begins to feel better.
