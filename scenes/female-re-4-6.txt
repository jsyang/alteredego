You walk around for hours in a maze of blinking lights, whirring motors, robots and other electronic gizmos. One display looks mildly amusing -- it is a space-age chair that records your brainwaves and produces a humming sound
guaranteed to make you relax.

You sit in it and fit on the headpiece. "You know something," you say to yourself. "This really works!" You begin to get a bit groggy.

It's not long before you drift off. You notice ${loverName} wandering off to check something out. Your feet are tired. This feels so good.
*page_break
"BRAAAAaaaAAAAACK!" You snore so loudly that the person at the display booth decides to use you as a living announcement and broadcast your snore over the loudspeaker. ${loverName} comes by and wakes you up. It's bad enough that your snoring was
broadcast to everyone at the show, but when you take the headgear off, you notice that your hair is sticking straight up!
*page_break
"Nothing to worry about, Miss," the salesman mumbles, "Just static electricity. It wears off in about an hour."

*set TH%+30
You feel like your eyes are beginning to close, but you are afraid of falling asleep in the chair. To counteract the effect of the relaxation, you force yourself to keep them open, taking on the appearance of one of those goldfish with
the bulging eyes. ${loverName} sees you and becomes afraid that you are being electrocuted.

After the electronics show, he takes you out to dinner to show his appreciation.

${loverName} takes another guest. They are both so "charged up" by the show, that they run off together after the performance, get married (by an electronic preacher)  and live happily ever after! He tells you to LOG OFF.

The two of you peruse all of the electronic gadgetry. Eventually, you come upon an interesting-looking electronic chair that measures your brainwaves and produces a computer-generated tone, guaranteed to help you relax.
*page_break
You sit in it and try on the headpiece.

"Hey, this seems to work!" you think to yourself.
