At the last minute, you become the only person available to drive a group of five howling, screeching, rambunctious, overactive first-graders to their first school play.

What kind of excuse can you possibly have for not wanting to take a group of sweet, lovable, excited little actors and actresses to their first show?

You know, people always seem to have just passed away around the time that others ask for favors. It must be a medical fact. Your excuse is not creative, but most people are polite enough not to call someone's bluff when a shabby excuse
involves death.

This excuse will surely get you out of any driving chores. The parents of the children are repulsed. You don't have to drive the children, but your Social sphere drops dramatically.

"Ha! Ha! Such a kidder!" No one believes this corny excuse. They think you are just being your usual raucous, jovial self. Start warming up the car.

Isn't that too bad? It's kind of hard to pity you. It's not exactly like heavy combat duty (although it is close). Everyone thinks you are being melodramatic. Social sphere declines.

Chances are this protest is too mild to deter those involved, who keep begging you to drive the children until you finally give in. Once you arrive at the school play, there is a second catastrophe -- an actor scheduled to play a major
role, "the giant mushroom," has fallen ill with chicken pox. Would you be willing to fill in for him, PLEEAASE?

Bravo! Your "giant mushroom" performance is riveting. You could easily win the Tony award for Best Supporting Role as a Fungus!

Grouch! How could you let these poor little children have a play without a giant mushroom? Oh well. "The show must go on," and it does, minus the fungus. BOO!

On the way to the play there is the usual cacophony of seven-year-olds' high-pitched squeals, with an occasional "STOP THAT!" One child is nervous about the play and requests that you pull over for a moment to release some of his
butterflies, along with today's lunch.

After this event the other children banish him to a corner of the car with chants of, "GROSS! GROSS! GROSS!" When you arrive at the school auditorium, you are informed of a catastrophe -- "the giant mushroom" has fallen ill with chicken
pox. Would you be willing to fill in for him, PLEEAASE?

What a wonderful human being! The children pile into the car yelling and screaming, their eyeballs bulging out of their sockets from excitement. Two blocks from the school auditorium, one of the children reports that he has forgotten an
important stage prop for the show -- he is Mr. Sun and has forgotten his Mr. Sun ray hat.
*page_break
Of course, you must return home to retrieve the hat. When you arrive at the auditorium for the second time, you are informed of another catastrophe -- "the
giant mushroom" has fallen ill with chicken pox. Would you be willing to fill in for him, PLEEAASE?
