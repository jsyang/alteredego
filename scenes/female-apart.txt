Your self-control is quite remarkable. Look at all of those tiny little bottles and tubes. No one would notice if you touched a few. Want to go back and try again?

You pluck out some of the more interesting-looking items, tasting one or two as you go along. They are definitely not for eating. You know Mom will be pleased with how nice you will look after you put some of her lipstick on!

You know you shouldn't touch Mom's things. Want to stop now while everything is still in one piece?

Your mom gasps at what you've done. Your dad blames her for leaving it within your reach. She tells him that you ate two of his charge cards. You get whacked on the bottom.

Your mom spends an afternoon trying to salvage some of her make-up, and finally gives up. She spends fifty dollars to replace it.
