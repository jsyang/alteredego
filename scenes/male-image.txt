Well, a little bit of self-praise never hurt anyone. Let's just try to keep it in perspective.

That must have been difficult to admit. Nervousness can come from a variety of sources, such as unrealistic expectations of what we could or should be doing with our lives. If this is the case, you should try to evaluate yourself a bit
more sensibly. You are only capable of doing so much. The world will probably not fall apart if you don't deliver 110 percent.

That must have been difficult to admit. People who are truly selfish would never admit it. They believe that they NEVER have enough. Take it easy on yourself. You may be too self-critical.

That doesn't seem to make much sense, judging from your status sheet. Perhaps you are not meeting the TYPE of friends you would like to meet. If this is the case, you may have to change your style of socializing actively. If you believe
that your personality is holding you back, check your Emotional sphere characteristics.

Have you been making impulsive choices? Have you noticed yourself choosing self-centered kinds of responses, instead of attending to the needs of others? You can certainly change these patterns once you become aware of them.

Judging by your status sheet, it does seem that you have been having trouble with social relationships. Think about these questions:

Have you been avoiding social experiences? Have you been making impulsive choices? Have you noticed yourself choosing self-centered kinds of responses, instead of attending to the needs of others? You can certainly change these patterns
once you begin to become aware of them.

Consider whether or not you are too self-centered. Those who lose their patience with others often feel like people aren't being attentive enough to their needs. This leads to a "You-had-better-do-it- for-me-because-I-am-so- special"
attitude. Get a more realistic attitude about yourself, and maybe you won't expect so much from others.

This can be a very difficult problem to control. Perhaps you should try to tune in to your tendency to be self-destructive. Impulsive people are prone to make quick decisions because deep down inside they believe their lives are not
valuable, and therefore not worth protecting.

Many times depression is the result of anger that is taken in instead of expressed. Examine yourself. Do you find that the decisions you make are based on the needs of others? If so, you may resent them for it, become angry and then hold
it in until it makes you feel depressed.
