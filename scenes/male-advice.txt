You have seen your friend, John, and his wife, Marsha, socially for a long time. They have a very peculiar relationship. Marsha insists on controlling every aspect of John's life.
*page_break
One day, when you are talking to John, he confesses that about three years ago, he began seeing another woman, one who is beautiful, kind, gentle and loving. He has been thinking about leaving Marsha for this other woman, but is unsure if
he can.

This must have been a difficult decision. Giving him advice would be taking responsibility for a decision that he alone should make. Stepping aside might distance you from your friend for a while, but in the end, it is worth it.

Advice given under duress is almost always bad advice. John resents you for meddling regardless of the outcome.

What kind of advice are you going to give him?

John tells you that he and Marsha have already been to several marriage counselors. Two marriage counselors got so fed up with Marsha that, for the sake of their OWN sanity, they refused to see the couple anymore. Two others said that the
problem was John's own wimpiness and desire to be controlled, which John knew anyway, but couldn't help. Do you want to give John any more advice?

You WOULD recommend something like this. Taking the cowardly, untrustworthy way has long been your trademark in life. John feels uncomfortable doing this and later resents you for making the suggestion.

Obviously this piece of advice really isn't very good. If John could comfortably continue the affair, he wouldn't be asking for your advice, now, would he?

Very simple advice. Just like that, pick up a whole relationship, a whole life, and transfer to another. Think about what phase of life you are in now. Chances are John and Marsha have been together for twenty years or more. For a guy who
is used to getting structure and direction from a person like Marsha, this kind of move would be terrifying.
*page_break
Your intentions are good -- you want to see John happier than he is now. The fact is that regardless of how a relationship looks to outsiders, when two people stay together, they usually have complementary sets of needs. Believe it or
not, he may actually DESIRE a woman who is as domineering as Marsha.
*page_break
Your advice to him is logical, but people often do not act that way. As a result, John's ambivalence turns to anger, which he directs at you for butting into his life.

What kind of advice is this? I can't imagine why you would even suggest it, and neither can John. He resents you for butting into his life and the two of you begin to grow apart.

The sound of breaking glass punctuates your otherwise relaxing afternoon. You are glad you don't have to deal with any of this.
