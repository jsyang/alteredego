${childName} has developed the habit of dashing away from you and running toward the street at full speed. You have tried everything to prevent this, but nothing seems to work. While your hands are full of heavy grocery bags, ${childName} scoots away
from you and nearly gets run over by a car which swerves to avoid hitting the baby.

  #YELL AT THE BABY

  #SMACK THE BABY ON THE BOTTOM

${childName} thinks you are playing a game. Your yelling does little to prevent this from happening again in the future.

This frightens ${childName}, mostly because of the surprise at being smacked. With deep, heaving sobs ${childName} begins to cry a long stream of tears. This may help to prevent her from doing this again in the future, but you can't quite help feeling
like a bit of a heel.

Dr. Spock (not to mention Dr. Favaro) would say "Tsk, Tsk." to this. Physical punishment should only be used as an absolute last resort, and should never be implemented so far after the fact. You need to brush up on your baby care. Your
child may grow up to resent you!
