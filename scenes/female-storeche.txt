Two days later she finds that she really did give you a dollar bill by mistake. Come to think of it, you never checked, either. I guess parents can be wrong sometimes, too.

You tell the policewoman the story. She inquires about the incident. The storeowner says, "Listen, Toots, the little brat gave me a 'one.'" This was the wrong thing to say to the policewoman. She makes the man check the cash register.
He has four dollars more than he should.

The policewoman calls the station house and finds out that he has done this three times in the last week. Two weeks later, the store is shut down. It was a front for a numbers racket. The storeowner is never heard from again.
