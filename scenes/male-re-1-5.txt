You and ${loverName} have spent the evening watching television upstairs in your room. It's a quiet night, and the two of you snuggle into each other's arms and begin to nap. You are disturbed from your peaceful sleep by the sound of birds
chirping outside the window.
*page_break
You open your eyes and realize you have fallen asleep for six hours. It's 4:37 a.m.! ${loverName}'s father would have a fit if he ever caught you bringing his daughter home this late. What will you do?

${loverName}'s father is asleep on the couch directly facing the door. He has obviously been waiting for the two of you to arrive. You notice, while he's snoring, the massive size of his mouth. He is wearing paisley pajama bottoms and his large
belly is heaving up and down as he breathes.

You and ${loverName} are frozen in panic, but she has to make a move soon. She tries to tiptoe past him...she has only three feet to go until she reaches the stairs...SNORT! SNORT! SNORT!

He rolls over on the couch and sinks deeper into dreamland. The next day ${loverName} claims to have been late, but not THAT late. Her father fell asleep at 12:30, so he has no way of checking her story.

After all, the truth can't hurt, right? That is correct -- but only provided that the person to whom you are telling the truth actually believes it is the truth. ${loverName}'s father does not believe you fell asleep watching television.
*page_break
He would prefer to believe that the two of you spent all night doing frivolous, immoral and perverted things to one another (after all, that is what HE did when he was your age), and hence treats you as such. He banishes you from the
house, never to return. ${loverName}'s mom is much more understanding. She tells you to pay no attention to that "old goat."

You don't expect him to fall for that old story, do you? (That's the same story HE used when he was your age.) He banishes you from the house, never to return, and exiles ${loverName} to her room for eternity. A bit strict, don't you think? The
next day, ${loverName}'s mother calls to tell you not to pay attention to that "old goat."

You were ready for a bit of lecturing, but instead you get an entire study-at-home combination course on ethics, morals, responsibility and the importance to your life of maintaining the purity and integrity of his daughter. When he is
finished, you wish him a good morning, go home, and cook yourself breakfast. What a night!
