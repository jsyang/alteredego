A group of men are getting together and forming a softball league called "The Senior Sluggers." In order to play in this league, you have to be sixty-five or older. The idea seems like a worthwhile way of getting exercise.

O.K. The rules of being in this league are as follows: (1) No sliding; (2) Underhand pitching only; (3) Every player in the league must dress in full uniform for every scheduled game. What position would you like to play?

That's the spirit! You try out for your position and make the STARTING TEAM. In the ninth inning, a high pop fly is hit directly to you. You thrust out your glove in an attempt to field the ball. The excitement of the play fills your
whole body...

The ball THUNKS solidly into the glove, knocking you off-balance. Your heart is beating furiously from the thrill of making the play. You feel happy and carefree, just like a child again. Suddenly, the field begins to fade and turn black.

The last thing you see are players from both benches running out to greet you for making such a great play. Something's wrong. You can't run toward them. Your body and hands won't respond to your wishes, but instead of feeling
frustration, you feel great peace. How you only wish you could have said good-bye.

The ball THUNKS solidly into the glove, knocking you off-balance. You have made the play. The sides are retired (no pun intended, there, grandpa). You are the team's MVP!

Sometimes older folks get bored with life and just wait around to die. They believe that activity, fun and enjoyment are just for the young ones. This is unfortunate. Inactivity is probably one of the biggest causes of depression
among older people because it causes isolation.

If you don't DO anything, you won't interact with anyone. This brings on loneliness and depression. Take a few more risks. Get out there and live a little!
