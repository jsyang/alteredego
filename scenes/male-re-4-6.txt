The opera seems to go on for hours. You can feel yourself nodding off from time to time. It is very dark and no one would notice if you took a little nap.

BRAAAAaaaAAAAACK! You snore so loudly that the entire row begins to vibrate. A few of the other patrons chuckle, but most of them are miffed. ${loverName} is embarrassed, but gets a little chuckle out of your behavior, nonetheless.

That is very considerate of you. In order to do this, you must keep your eyes bulging wide open. If you close them for a second you will be out like a light. ${loverName} looks over, sees you and interprets this as a sign that you are in the same
kind of rapture as she. She is considerate enough to buy you a cassette tape of the opera so you can play it in your car.

${loverName} takes another guest, an opera lover. They are both so enraptured by the show, that they run off together after the performance, get married, and live happily ever after! LAAAAAA!

${loverName} enjoys the opera, too. As a matter of fact, it is one of those things that gives her such thrills that it turns her into a real tiger afterwards. When the two of you return from the opera, you make beautiful music together.
