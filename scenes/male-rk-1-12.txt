You hear a sharp click and feel the sting of the bat meeting the ball. You look skyward, expecting to see the ball rocket out of the stadium.... The second baseman scoops up your dribbling grounder and throws you out before you
take ten steps toward the bag. The batting coach has a baseball tip for you-- take up golf! Better luck next season. For now, you don't make the team.

CRAAAAAAAACK! The ball sails over the centerfielder's head. Similarly, every time you step up to the plate during tryouts you drive the ball deep into the outfield. Congratulations, you've made the team. You are now a bona fide jock!
