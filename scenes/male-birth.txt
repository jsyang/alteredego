You are in a warm, dark, comfortable place. This has been your place since you became aware that you are alive. It's almost time to enter a different world now.

O.K. You certainly can't be blamed for wanting to stay someplace safe and warm. Besides, you are learning early the social merits of being "fashionably late."

Don't you think your mother has had enough aggravation, carrying you in her belly for nine long months? Stop being a freeloader and step out into the real world!

You are setting a pattern of avoiding responsibility that may develop into a serious problem later on. If you don't come out soon, you will have to be surgically removed, and your mother will resent you for that.

Now you've done it. Your mother's obstetrician has just been pulled off the 10th hole to come in and deliver you via Caesarean section. You aren't even a minute old and you are a troublemaker. Fortunately, you have your whole life to
redeem yourself.

Yes, I can certainly understand how troublesome it can seem to be evicted unexpectedly. You have every right to feel angry. You were getting a little too big to be carried around in your mom's belly -- those
backaches were really starting to get on her nerves.

Besides, your dad had to suffer through a lot for the past couple of months and wasn't exactly Mr. Sunshine either. Get ready to be born in a flurry of waving arms, screams and a slap on the bottom.

Ouch! Those forceps are denting your skull. Is this any way to treat a star? A bundle of joy? You haven't learned to talk yet so all you can do is yell until you are red in the face, which everyone interprets as a sign of good health.

Yes, this is a strange and confusing world you have been brought into, so save your strength for the events to come.

You may be a fighter, but your mom wants you out with more energy than you have to stay in. You will find that anything of value in life is worth fighting for. This fight ends in a draw -- you are evicted, but your mom is pooped.

Soon you meet her and snuggle up nice and close. All is forgiven -- for now. Get ready to be born in a flurry of waving arms, screams, and a slap on the bottom.

What a good sport. Are you sure you're ready for this? It can get pretty hectic out there. I'll give you one more chance to try to stay a while longer. Would you like to?

I know it's a little bit early to say that you are too easily influenced by other's opinions, but after getting up the nerve to be so courageous, why back out (or back in, in this case) just because of me?

That's the spirit! You are an easy delivery (your mom and dad took special classes to help you). Go out there and give 'em heck. (You're still too young to swear.)

Happy Birthday, and welcome to the world. From now on, life will begin to change rapidly. You will have to learn to accept responsibility, build up your resources, and manage yourself physically and emotionally.
