You have just passed through the CHILDHOOD phase of life.

very well. Dad is still the greatest hero of all time, and Mom is pretty terrific, too.
*goto PH

poorly. You don't seem to have the strong contact with your family that helps provide the foundation for good relationships, later.
*label PH

Physically, you are

healthy. You contract the standard fare of childhood diseases, assorted sniffles, coughs, bumps and stomach aches.

not very healthy. Be careful to avoid situations that could lead to illness.

Socially, this can be an awkward phase of life, especially when you hit the ripe old age of nine or ten. Should you like girls? Should you not like girls? Decisions, decisions. All in all,
*if SC>70

you are extremely loveable. You are well-mannered and respectful of adults. I may be mistaken, but I see a little bit of a Cassonova-In-Training.

you are developing good social skills. You don't always close your mouth when you are chewing food, but hey, nobody's perfect.
*goto EMO
*label D.F
your manners need more minding. Adults see you as a rude child, not particularly well bred. You have a tendency to seek attention in negative ways.

Now, regarding your emotional and personality development...

You are not the kind of boy that can be easily trusted. Some people might even call you downright sneaky at times.

Your trustworthiness and sense of fair play are commendable. You are an honest child, but no tattle-tale either.
*goto GN
*label F.F
You are a remarkably trustworthy young man. Your sense of ethics and fair play are quite remarkable for a child your age.

  *goto G.F
*label G.T
The degree to which you display aggressive types of behavior is somewhat alarming. You can be nasty and spiteful at times.
*goto ENDIT
*label G.F
You have a gentle, easy-going way about you most of the time. You have not had very many schoolyard brawls, and you seem to be able to control your temper, even when the girls giggle as you walk by.
*label ENDIT
*page_break
You are about to enter adolescence. It is a somewhat hectic time of life, full of surprises. There will be many very high highs, and many low lows. With each year you will gain responsibilities.
*page_break
You may also notice that people will begin to start forgiving you less for things previously described as mere childhood habits. You will be expected to leave your burping and other questionable talents in the social circles where they are
unanimously approved of -- your peer group.
*page_break
Oh, yes...then there's the matter of girls. If you haven't noticed them much in this phase, watch out. They've noticed you!!
