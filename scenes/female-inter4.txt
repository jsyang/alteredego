In this phase of life you have faced several sensitive issues. These included what crowd of people to associate with and what material items bring recognition from this crowd. Somewhere along the line, you may have devoted a
portion of your life to a worthy social cause like a charity event or the Peace Corps. Your social skills are

By this time, you may have been feeling a bit of pressure to achieve, get ahead, buy a house or possibly even (gasp!) settle down. You have gone through quite a range of experiences already, but there is a great deal more to come.
