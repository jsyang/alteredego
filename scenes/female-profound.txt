You have just met an old friend whom you haven't seen for years. She looks absolutely incredible -- thin, stylish, expensive clothes, the works. You find out that she is a very successful advertising account manager with a large firm.

After her divorce, she decided to take a new lease on life; and sure enough, she's a different person. Before you part, you tell her, "God, you really look terrific."

Her reply is: "You haven't changed a bit."

You must be a very confident person. Good for you! She may look like she has it all, but looks can be deceiving. Everyone has her share of troubles, but you can manage the ones you have just fine. Confidence and Intelligence both increase.

I guess you must feel that there is no way out of the situation you are in, so you have no choice but to grin and bare it. As you may have already found out, there's ALWAYS at least one other choice. Why don't you try some?

That's the spirit! It is often a good idea to take inventory of your life and try to improve it constructively. Some people get themselves angry to give them the energy to start. This is fine, as long as you don't get down on yourself
too much in the process.
