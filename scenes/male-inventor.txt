You and a group of friends are sitting around discussing people that you used to know. It seems that an "odd-ball" acquaintance of yours who became a recluse, always holed up in his workshop, has just invented a pocket
golf-ball washer that has earned him a large fortune.
*page_break
After making all of that money, instead of retiring, he has chosen to donate it to a charity for homeless inventors, and is now back at work! Sure enough, just two weeks after this discussion, he shows up at a social function.
*page_break
Naturally, everyone who speaks with him has a remark to make about his behavior. Eventually, he wanders over to the group of people with whom you are having a discussion.

This must have been a very easy set of choices for you. In adolescence, it is understandable that people who are "different" become scapegoats. In adults, this behavior is more difficult to understand. He is different, true, but
he may also be a nice person. He walks out of the gathering looking lonely and depressed. He is the type of person who will probably not be understood by many.

In a quiet voice, he asks if he can speak to you privately about something.

Even though you made an outward effort to be supportive, deep down inside you are afraid of what the others might think if they see you behaving too friendly towards him.

He thanks you for the kind words, and mentions that he realizes everyone around him thinks he's a nut. You have never really heard him talk at length, but you find out that he really doesn't care what other people think, and never did.
He has a very enjoyable life on the whole.

It seems that he needs 10000 dollars of "seed money" to get his newest project going--a scheme to invent a trash compactor that converts garbage into an energy product that can heat your home. If you invest the money, you will
receive half of all the profits that the project generates.

The project becomes an overwhelming success. This time, instead of donating his profits, he buys his own island in the tropics and retires, turning his attention to inventing a better recipe for pina coladas!
