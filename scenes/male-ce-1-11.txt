You have just realized that you will never have the time to do a Political Science term paper that is due in three days. You are approached by someone with a pencil-thin moustache who will gladly sell you a term paper and
guarantee at least a B. The cost is five dollars. What do you want to do?


Select an action:

  #BUY THE TERM PAPER
    *goto A1
  #ASK FOR AN EXTENSION FROM YOUR POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR
    *goto A2
  #TRY TO DO IT ANYWAY
    *goto A3
*label A1
*set IN%-20
The term paper looks somewhat familiar to your Political Science professor--as a matter of fact, this was a paper SHE published about two years ago. Your grade on the paper is F- (which isn't even a real grade, but your paper
wasn't a real paper, either).
*page_break
Intellectual score goes down--not for failing the paper, but for being stupid enough to buy it from that seedy-looking guy in the first place.
*finish
*label A2
*if GN>70
  *goto B.T
*else
  *goto B.F
*label B.T
*set HP%+20
Your professor sees that you are sincere. Your Gentleness characteristic helps you get a one week extension on your paper.
*finish
*label B.F
You don't have enough of the Gentleness characteristic to get the extension. You sound too hostile and defensive.
*finish
*label A3
*if IN>80
  *goto C.T
*else
  *goto C.F
*label C.T
*set IN%+10
You have the intellectual skills necessary to do a good paper, even in the limited time you have to do the work. You get a B+.
*finish
*label C.F
*set IN%-10
*set SC%+10
*set VC%+5
You don't have the intellectual skills to do this task in such a limited time. As a result, you get a D on the paper. You DID make a valiant attempt, though. I admire that.
*finish
