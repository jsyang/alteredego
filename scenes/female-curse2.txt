You have just discovered that your best friend's boyfriend has pooled his life savings to buy her a pair of diamond earrings for her birthday. Later that evening, she tells you she is thinking of "dumping" him because she is not sure if
they make a good couple.

She tells you she really wasn't thinking of "dumping" him. It was just that she didn't know whether or not he really loved her. Now she knows.

Birds of a feather flock together. She is just as devious as you are. She stays with him until after he gives her the earrings, then breaks off with him. She lets you borrow them whenever you want.

It must be difficult to resist the temptation, but in the end things work out for the best. She was so surprised by the earrings that the relationship was miraculously renewed. Any action on your part could have seemed like meddling.

That is what your friend screams when she discovers what you did. I know: you were only trying to be a good sport. Even so, your choices showed bad judgment. Eventually, your girlfriend and her boyfriend get back together, and she gets
the earrings. They see you as a trouble-maker and stop hanging around with you.

A little on the cold side, don't you think? You must have a difficult time with relationships.

Months later, your friend finds out that you knew about the earrings all the while. She gets angry at you for not letting her know, and the two of you grow apart.
