No one is home except you and ${loverName}. You are on the couch necking with him, locked in a passionate horizontal embrace. Suddenly, you hear a faint, "CLICK!" Someone's coming in!

Your hair looks like it was arranged with an electric mixer, proceeding outward from your head at seemingly impossible angles. Also, you accidentally tucked your blouse into the couch. As it turns out, the noise was coming from
outside. You can go back to what you were doing. But first, fix your hair!

Hah! Who would believe that? Nobody! Fortunately, the sound you heard was just an outside noise. There really wasn't anyone coming in. Now, please go fix your hair. It looks like the two of you were victims of a runaway blow dryer.

Very creative...but save it! As it turns out, the sound you heard was just an outside noise. You can go back to what you were doing, but before you do, it might be a good idea to look in a mirror. Your hair looks like a squirrel
just did forty laps around the top of your head.

No need to make excuses for true love. As it turns out, the sound was just an outside noise, anyway. No matter; the only thing that could have disturbed the two of you was a major earthquake, and THAT might have even made things a
bit more interesting!
