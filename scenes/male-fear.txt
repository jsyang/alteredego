You walk into your bedroom about to go to sleep. The dark shapes stare at you from every corner of the room. Headlights cast eerie shadows on the walls. You have heard that the TOAD MONSTER sneaks into little boys' rooms and hides
under the bed. You can almost hear him breathing now, just like the stories said.

You search under the bed and see the shadows of toys and socks left under the bed. A stuffed animal's glassy eyes shine through the darkness. Everything is quiet. What was that? Only a noise from downstairs. The TOAD MONSTER doesn't
seem to be here...tonight, anyway.

Hiding under the covers, all sounds are magnified. Your breathing sounds like the waves at the ocean. Your heart is pounding fast. You imagine that the TOAD MONSTER is sitting up on your bed just waiting for you to peek up so that he
can BITE YOU IN THE FACE!!!

You stay under the covers and accept the fact that this might be your last night on earth. The TOAD MONSTER will eat you all up right after you close your eyes, but you are tired and feel yourself sinking into sleep. In your dreams
tonight you will meet the TOAD MONSTER and fry him with your X-RAY vision!

You bring the covers away from your head and find a large, dark, ugly figure staring into your eyes. COVER YOUR FACE! IT'S HIM!!! No...wait a minute...it's only Dad. You begin to tell him about the TOAD MONSTER but you know he
probably wouldn't understand.

Better safe than sorry, I guess. It's kind of hard to go to sleep thinking that you might be the TOAD MONSTER's midnight snack. Can you sleep knowing that the TOAD MONSTER is right this very second looking at you through the crack
between the door of your room and the hallway outside?

You are so tired that you don't have the energy to be afraid of the TOAD MONSTER, do you? You quickly fall asleep and dream that the TOAD MONSTER is chasing you around the house.
