There is a concert in the Student Center, and you have made arrangements to go with your friend, Bobby, and his new girlfriend, Linda. You are supposed to meet them in Bobby's dorm room, then go with them to pick up your date.
You arrive on time, but notice that Bobby and Linda are a bit rumpled in appearance. It seems you have interrupted a romantic interlude.
*page_break
Bobby excuses himself so that he can shower and get ready for the concert. Linda is still glassy-eyed from tumbling around the room with Bobby. There is a moment of uncomfortable silence after Bobby walks down the hall to the
showers. Linda moves close to you and tells you that you have a bad sense of timing.
*page_break
She leans toward you and enquires if you would like to "finish what Bobby started?"

Linda gives you a long, sensuous kiss and pushes you down on the bed. The door creaks open. The showers were being used and Bobby had to wait a while before using them. When he sees the two of you, he kicks you both out. Do you want
to start seeing this girl regularly?

The next time you make arrangements to see her, you arrive only to be greeted by a happy-looking fellow who is walking out of her room. She has decided you are too "mellow" for her.
