It's time to give the baby a bath. How do you feel?

I'm sure you are TRYING to be calm and relaxed, but this kind of calmness is not in your personality. The baby senses your tension and stiffens up in the water. Between your soapy hands and the baby's movements, you almost drop the child
in the tub.

Fortunately, everything turns out well.

You are a calm and relaxed person in general. You keep the baby's attention on you as you support it in the warm water. A warm water bath is not something that babies are all that unfamiliar with, you know. Your reactions are
likely to influence the child more than anything else.

Being a new mommy certainly has its share of worries. Perhaps you are afraid that you will drop the baby into the water. Actually, the danger in giving a small infant a bath comes from the possibility of accidentally scalding the
baby with hot water.

A warm water environment is not exactly foreign to an infant. Your reactions usually set the tone of such experiences. I'm sure you will do just fine.
