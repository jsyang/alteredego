Your mother has given you permission to have a party. You want to invite most of the kids from your class. There is one child that you have second thoughts about inviting. His name is Louis Feiback. All of the kids call him "Louie
Feedbag" because he is very fat.

You mention to your group of friends that you are thinking about inviting Louis. They make faces and pig noises. Some of them say that if you invite "The Bag" they will stay home.

Sure! Take the easy way out. Resolve your ambivalence by putting the guilt on Louis. Can you blame him after the way he has been treated? Everyone has a great time at your party. Louis stays home that night, cries, and eats to
fill the emptiness of having no friends.

Louis is completely overjoyed. This is the first time he has ever felt like one of "the guys." Some of your friends do stay home that night and refuse to speak with you at school. Louis' mother calls you up and thanks you for being so
generous.

Louis' mother also happens to be extremely rich. On your next school vacation, she flies you and Louis to Hawaii for a week to stay with relatives there. Aloha!

Louis has heard from other people in school that you were thinking about inviting him. Although he was prepared for rejection (it has happened so many times he could expect nothing else), there was still a glimmer of hope. He
spends the night of your party crying and eating to fill up the emptiness of having no friends.

*set SC%+30

You call the kids who don't want him there a bunch of jerks and threaten to beat up anyone who makes fun of Louis at your party. You have shown courage and tolerance for individual differences and this has made you stronger.
