You are in a large department store shopping for some clothing. When you left the house this morning, you didn't have time to shave, so you look just a bit on the grubby side. You have a question for the salesperson, but you can't
seem to attract his attention.
*page_break
Every time you say, "Excuse me," he says, "Just a minute, Sir," and chats with another salesperson about what seems to be a social matter rather than a business matter.

The salesperson looks at you and gives you an obvious sneer. Before he helps you, he turns to the person to whom he was talking and says in a voice loud enough for you to hear, "Some people are so UNCIVILIZED."

This doesn't bother them one bit. Besides, I get the feeling they didn't want you in there in the first place. Fortunately, you are smart enough to leave the store before doing something impulsive like punching the salesperson.

Your biggest mistake was to approach the salesperson in a hostile manner. You could have tried a more assertive approach instead.

You have no chance. They beat you badly, leaving you with a black eye and three bruised ribs. They also call the police and swear out a formal complaint against you. If you are seen anywhere in the vicinity of the store again,
they will have you arrested and put in jail. What do you want to do now?

You succeed. The store is burned to the ground. By the time the firefighters put it out there is more than a million dollars worth of damage done to the store.

By the way, you also get caught. Your fingerprints were found all over the crime scene. The case against you is open and shut. You are sentenced to three years in a federal penitentiary. After six months you are released. You now
have a criminal record. Did you learn anything from this incident?

When you were a child, I probably told you that you would grow up to be a hardened criminal. If I didn't, I should have. You will probably be in trouble for the rest of your life. I suppose I could say it's not too late to change,
but I don't think it would do much good.

This was INDEED an assertive response. The salesperson resents your interruption, but helps you anyway. He is careful not to say anything snide or sarcastic because he knows that you are the kind of customer who will calmly
but firmly insist that the store manager haul his obnoxious butt out of there and out of a job. You get what you want without expending too much energy.
*finish
*label J2
This is NOT an assertive response. This is an aggressive response because you criticized the salesperson. An assertive response is one that expresses a feeling (like the one you DIDN'T choose). People often get the two confused.
It takes some practice to do it with positive results. You will have more chances. For now the result is as follows:

Because you remain calm and do not display any signs of discomfort at being treated so rudely, the salesperson continues to walk all over you. It is another half-hour before you finally get helped and can leave the store. How
do you feel now?
